Companies see this, and will spend whatever it takes to build AGI. This creates a generational investment opportunity, particularly in two key areas: foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure plays. I'm deploying \\\\~$100K with this thesis. I'd love your thoughts on this, and am looking to incorporate feedback.\\n\\n**The Thesis:**\\n\\nWe are witnessing the early stages of perhaps the most significant technological revolution in human history. The evidence suggests we're approaching an inflection point in artificial intelligence that will reshape the entire economy. Here's why this matters for investors:\\n\\n**Key Technical Developments:**\\n\\n* Transformer architecture has fundamentally solved previous algorithmic and data constraints\\n* Larger models consistently demonstrate superior capabilities\\n* Critical breakthrough in reasoning capabilities (building on techniques from game theory/poker)\\n* Major capability jumps expected with upcoming models (GPT-5, Gemini-2)\\n\\nBusiness Implications:\\n\\n1. The Prize: Human intelligence and agency have historically been the greatest constraints on economic growth. AGI would effectively remove these constraints.\\n2. Follow the Money:\\n   * Current AI capex spending at big tech companies is >$150B annually\\n   * For comparison: The tech bubble peak saw $250B/year in broadband infrastructure in today’s dollars\\n   * Unlike the tech bubble, today's AI investments are being made by cash-rich tech giants with fortress balance sheets\\n   * Training next-gen models will require hundreds of billions in compute investment\\n3. The Economics Are Compelling:\\n   * Leading tech companies each generate $100B+ in annual revenue\\n   * They can invest off their balance sheet with extremely low cost of debt\\n   * Early evidence shows strong ROI on AI investments (e.g., Microsoft/OpenAI revenue growth)\\n\\n  \\n**Investment Strategy:** I'm deploying $100K across foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure, with a small allocation to energy. Here's the detailed breakdown:\\n\\n[Overall Portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/9atytvnu6lxd1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=9da96520090f2e014f5f1bd82af30eb67c1a8fca)\\n\\n* Foundation Model Companies (50%): Based on comprehensive benchmarking data from [LiveBench.ai](http://LiveBench.ai), weighted by demonstrated capabilities across reasoning, coding, mathematics, data analysis, language, and instruction following:\\n\\n[Foundation Model Weighting](https://preview.redd.it/qs43dkgc7lxd1.png?width=2900&format=png&auto=webp&s=04ed97a4b7e9f0111f944633fbf12f3ea9995ea7)\\n\\n   1. Google (Gemini-1.5-Pro): 11.77% \\n   2. Microsoft (OpenAI Partnership): 10.66% \\n   3. Amazon/Google (Anthropic Investment): 9.79%\\n   4. Meta (LLaMA): 9.49% \\n   5. Tesla (xAI): 8.30% \\n* Datacenter Infrastructure (42%): Weighted according to typical datacenter capital expenditure breakdown:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u14rf0vi7lxd1.jpg?width=1126&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de34b7cdd3d81b7e017b0a06eed7a6102f8c2ddf\\n\\n   1. Servers/Compute: 31.47% Primary exposure through NVDA\\n   2. Networking: 4.53% Split across CSCO, ANET, JNPR\\n   3. Construction & Components: 5.99% Including:\\n      * XLI ETF: Exposure to industrials that will be involved in building these datacenters\\n* Energy Infrastructure (7.33%):\\n   1. XLU ETF: Exposure to utilities that will power this buildout\\n   2. This is based off datacenter variable (energy + colo) costs being approx 15% of the monthly cost of the datacenter, with the remaining being the capital costs of standing up the datacenter.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n **An interesting catalyst for why I think now is the time to buy into this:**\\n\\nThere's going to be some foundation models that will be released over the next few months that will reconfirm the returns to scale for these models. [\\\\[1\\\\]](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278999/openai-plans-orion-ai-model-release-december)[\\\\[2\\\\] ](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279600/google-next-gemini-ai-model-openai-december) The truly exciting thing is that these models will be able to take actions to do tasks on your computer. The main issue in the current iteration of models is that they are not reliably able to do long running goal oriented tasks, but the release of o1 changed my perspective on this problem. That model has been trained to go through chain-of-thought steps to get to the right answer, and its data will be used to train larger models on the entire reasoning sequence. This unlocks a whole bunch of learnable training data. Things are going to get even more exciting.   \\nI've been working on language models since GPT-1/BERT/etc, and the main thing is that every time a model comes out, we're all surprised at how much better it gets. I've learned to not be as skeptical of the returns to scale, and I'm finally putting (more) of my money where my mouth is. \"}, {'text': \"Usually, when things that are leaked with an intention the entity where the leak comes from is pleased with said leak. Not for Bloomberg though. Bloomberg actually accomplishes citing an anonymous source about on ongoing discussions related to chip distribution and subsequently takes that information to the White House National Security Council to ask them to comment. Here is the WHNSC's response.\\n\\nBloomberg: [US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-15/us-weighs-capping-exports-of-ai-chips-from-nvidia-and-amd-to-some-countries?leadSource=uverify%20wall&embedded-checkout=true)\\n\\n>A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent\\xa0[joint statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/23/united-states-and-united-arab-emirates-cooperation-on-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20and%20the%20UAE%20look%20forward%20to%20deepening%20collaboration,%2C%20secure%2C%20and%20trustworthy%20AI.)\\xa0by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.”\\n\\nThe council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is.\\n\\nThis is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not.\\n\\n>The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of **anonymity**. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said.\\n\\nThis isn't even news.

Which it is.\\n\\n[Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East](https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-sets-new-rule-that-could-spur-ai-chips-middle-east-2024-09-30/)\\n\\n>WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia\\xa0to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them.\\n\\nIf you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines.\\n\\nBloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article.\\n\\n>While officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road.\\n\\nWhat I don't understand is why does Bloomberg like to make things salacious when they're seemingly not. There is 0 chips to parts of the Middle-East today, but the U.S. government is working on a framework that may relieve that. Reuter story from a month ago. The end.\\n\\nWhen you read the headline one would believe that they are already selling these chips to the UAE and they're not.\"}, {'text': 'Insolvency is one hell of a word that nobody wants to hear but here we are. Volocopter is a German Advanced Air Mobility AAM company that has fallen on some bad times as of lately. Here\\'s what we know. The silence is deafening and there is blood in the waters. \\n\\nVolocopter had a direct relationship with investors such as Mercedes Benz-Group, Geely (also backing EHang), and Japanese Airlines JAL specifically via Sumitomo Group. Sumitomo group has invested millions into Volocopter through multiple funding rounds and most recently a Series E funding round that concluded March 4, 2023. \\n\\nTo date, Volocopter is ahead and behind in so many ways regarding the eVTOL AAM business. Volocopter is positioned in the Asia markets nicely in collaboration with Geely in China and Singapore obtaining flight agreements with local aviation authorities to integrate eVTOL services within Singapore\\'s urban transport network. Geely, gives them potential of market entry into China. All seem like good news and blue sky\\'s ahead. Not so fast. \\n\\nThe other Asian entry point is from JAL and Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo. This is where things start to get real interesting because the background news for JAL, Sumitomo, Volocopter, Mercedes, Geely, and Archer Aviation has been decimenting at a dizzying pace. The news for Volocopter and VoloCity is not good news for Volocopter at all. \\n\\nThis information broke on a Japanese website and was alerted to me on another reddit sub. [https://xtech.nikkei.com/atcl/nxt/column/18/02892/100200027/?n\\\\_cid=nbpnxt\\\\_twbn](https://xtech.nikkei.com/atcl/nxt/column/18/02892/100200027/?n_cid=nbpnxt_twbn) The site is in Japanese but you can translate it. The funny thing is it was not picked up by any US news sites as of yet. The news is telling and potentially disastrous for Volocopter. \\n\\n**10.04.2024 Sumitomo changes aircraft from Volocopter to Archer Aviation...** \\n\\n>Figure 1: Status of each company\\'s investigation published by the Japan Association for the 2025 World Exposition The big change is that JAL\\'s flight operations have been taken over by **Soracle**, a company jointly established by JAL and Sumitomo Corporation, and **the aircraft used has been changed from Germany\\'s Volocopter to the U.S. company Archer Aviation**. Incidentally, Marubeni is also considering using aircraft from the U.S. company Lift Aircraft (Source: Japan Association for the 2025 World Expo).\\n\\n>The major change from the status of consideration disclosed in August 2023 is that the flight operations that were previously planned to be carried out solely by Japan Airlines (JAL) will be taken over by Soracle, a new company jointly established by JAL and Sumitomo Corporation in June 2024. **In addition, the aircraft to be used has been changed from the Volocopter-type eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft \"VoloCity\" from Germany\\'s Volocopter to the fixed-wing aircraft \"Midnight (M001)\" from Archer Aviation of the United States** (\\xa0**Figure 2**\\xa0).\\n\\nArcher Aviation has not reported on this news yet. There has been nothing but silence. Why? \\n\\nBecause of this I did some digging. Let\\'s start with Volocopter. Why the switch? Turns out that Volocopter is going through a lot of turbulence right now. Remember, Volocopter is a private company so getting a lot of details is difficult but one can read the tea leaves. \\n\\nThe first sign of real trouble is none other than the Paris Olympics where Volocopter was supposed to have its day in the sun. The setup couldn\\'t have been more perfect for Volocopter eVTOL AAM entry point into the Asian and European air transportation markets. French President Emmanuel Macron was supposed to fly one from right inside central Paris as the first commercial eVTOL flying passenger. That never happened and in short, Dirk Hoke and Volocopter fumbled the ball or rather, pooched the kick. I don\\'t know many european phrases for \"they fucked it up\". \\n\\nFor some reason, Dirk Hoke and Volocopter thought that their 2 seater eVTOL/AAM in which 1 seat is a pilot and the other is a passenger was going to make it through the European Aviation Safety Agency EASA in time for the Paris Olympics. It did not and the eVTOL demonstration was scaled back significantly leaving perhaps a death blow to the eVTOL maker. \\n\\nThe fallout has been severe whilst coming from multiple angles and corresponding investment groups related to Volocopter. Reports started flying (more flight puns) that dreams were dashed and Volcopter failed to deliver. \\n\\n[August 8, 2024 France 24:](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240808-paris-flying-taxi-test-flights-scrapped-during-olympics)\\n\\n# Paris scraps plans for Olympic ‘flying taxis’\\n\\n>Despite initial promises, so-called \\'flying taxis\\' will not be circling above Paris during the Olympic Games this summer. German manufacturer Volocopter Thursday said it has scrapped test flights of the 18-rotor drones that resemble small helicopters over delays in the certification for the vehicle’s engine.\\n\\n>Volocopter CEO Dirk Hoke said the delay was due to \"an American supplier who was not capable of providing what he had promised\".\\n\\n>He said the motors would be sent back to France next week but not in time for the test flights to be held in Paris before the Olympics close.\\n\\n[August 9, 2024 Axios:](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/09/air-taxis-olympic-moment-whats-next) \\n\\n>**Why it matters:**\\xa0Air taxis were supposed to be\\xa0[zipping over Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAJQ1t6ErMg)\\xa0during the past two weeks, but the electric aircraft — which take off and land vertically — still need regulatory approval.\\n\\n>**Driving the news:**\\xa0One such company, Archer Aviation, plans to launch a Los Angeles air mobility network as early as 2026, it announced yesterday.\\n\\n[August 11, 2024 AP News reported:](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-paris-flying-taxis-82af3b21726dc6ebbc99da076b98d14b) \\n\\n# Air taxis failed to get certified for the Paris Olympics.

To put it nicely, they\\'re fucked. \\n\\nI don\\'t if you caught the repeated blaming by former, now transitioning, CEO Dirk Hoke of an anonymous \"American Supplier\" who seemingly did not deliver a part is the sole reason why they did not obtain EASA Type Certification. I get that this happens in hardware and hardware and manufacturing is well HARD. I understand that but the notion that your entire premises of existence is on a single American part is ridiculous and as my father used to tell me; I don\\'t want to hear excuses. \\n\\nAgain, the fallout from here would prove to be severe for both Dirk Hoke and Volocopter. For Dirk Hoke\\'s part [he is out as CEO of Volocopter](https://www.volocopter.com/en/newsroom/volocopter-to-undertake-leadership-changes). For Volocopter somewhere in the news cycle [via news publication The Air Current the words considering Insolvency and \"finding new funding\"](https://theaircurrent.com/feed/dispatches/volocopter-secures-new-funding-from-existing-investors/) has entered the chat; or rather the venture capital news corners. \\n\\nIt\\'s so bad that [Dirk Hoke has already found another job as of September 18, 2024](https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/news/dirk-hoke-appointed-as-new-ceo-of-voith-group/). \\n\\n>Dirk Hoke has been appointed as the new President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Voith GmbH & Co.

Where does all that Series Funding from A - E GO? Sumitomo in that news article as of 10/4/2024 seemingly backed out of Volocopter and  is now dealing with Archer Aviation. \\n\\nEven though Volocopter is private you can track their balance sheet roughly through [Crunchbase ](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/volocopter/company_financials)and other sources. They roughly have $579 million of investment from investors, including Geely, WP Investment, Mercedes-Benz Group, Intel Capital, and BlackRock as[ reported in their initial Series E funding round for $170 million](https://www.volocopter.com/en/newsroom/series-e-financing-round). But you\\'ll notice that they had a ridiculously long funding roundt that turned into a big Japanese pivot by the end - [Volocopter in Japan](https://www.volocopter.com/en/newsroom/japan-series-e-regulatory-pathway). So if we\\'re tracking, the Series E funding round went from March 4, 2022 to March 4, 2023 concluding on the Japanese JAL Sumitomo news. \\n\\nTo put it in perspective, OpenAI\\'s funding round started in October 2, 2024 and concluded in 2024. \\n\\nThe notion that Volocopter took an entire year to close a funding round can only mean one thing. Stipulations and milestones. And I mean stipulations and clauses like you\\'ve never imagined a contract could have. You don\\'t deliver TYPE certification we\\'re taking our money back. You don\\'t do this, we\\'re taking our money back. You don\\'t do that, we\\'re taking our investment back. Or, they never really got the investment in the first place through not reaching milestones. \\n\\nThe tea leaves are easy to follow here. You close Series E funding by the Japanese Osaka Asian corridor. You promise and underdeliver for the Paris Olympics and blame the Americans. You don\\'t receive TYPE Certification from EASA on time. All of this has lead to Japan now pulling the rug and the seemingly that $579 million investment is no longer Volocopter\\'s.\\n\\nThat\\'s how I read these tea leaves. Moreover, Archer has not given any recognition to the news that was laid out by that Japanese news paper. One can only surmise that the deal(s) are still being worked out by Archer, JAL, and Sumitomo. Something is there obviously but we just don\\'t know exactly what. \\n\\nNews on this, should be breaking soon if not immentily. \\n\\nIn the least, I would imagine Archer gets to take over any investment once promised to Volocopter from JAL/Sumitomo Group and is the reason Volocopter is in an absolute death spiral of solvency need. At the most, perhaps this is an opportunity for the first eVTOL AAM merger where Archer takes the entire investment, more investment, and portions of the Volocopter IP to obtain a larger Asian corridor presence in China and other premium Asian markets outside of just Japan. \\n\\nI hate to say it but for Volocopter this makes a lot of sense. The 2 seater aircraft is bland and uninspiring. It doesn\\'t yield the future but rather some teenagers scaled up a DJI drone and tried to make it a company. I hate to give the brutal take there but that is what their passenger aircraft looks like. The other parts of their business seem much more promising and practical like the transport drones and object delivery eVTOL plans. Leading with a 2 seater eVTOL is DOA in my opinion but they do have interesting pieces for sure such as an already up and running smaller size manufacturing plant located in Bruchsal, Germany. \\n\\nThis DD is highly speculative and is based on assumptions and news articles that are leading but not anything definitive. After, Joby\\'s Toyota announcement I believe Archer is cooking up their own major news announcement that coincides with their own regulatory approvals from the U.S. FAA, specifically the SFAR.\\n\\n The other news here worth noting is specifically what Japan Airlines has been doing in the eVTOL space. The company that I mentioned [Sumitomo Corporation and JAL jointly establish an eVTOL operating company as of June 3, 2024 named Soracle.](https://www.sumitomocorp.com/en/jp/news/topics/2024/group/20240603) \\n\\n>Sumitomo Corporation has been pursuing commercialization in air mobility services since 2018 as it seeks to diversify its longstanding aviation business. In 2020, as part of efforts to develop this new market in Japan, it invested in a company developing an air traffic control system for unmanned aircraft that will be critical when integrating these mobility services into society.\\n\\n>JAL aims to create relationships and social connections through the movement of people and goods by leveraging the technology, observations, and operational expertise it has accumulated in the air transportation business to operate air mobility services and further develop its business in Japan.\\n\\n>JAL and Sumitomo Corporation entered into a business alliance in the air mobility sector in 2020 (\\\\*2) and have been working toward the realization of eVTOL-based mobility services. In addition, the two companies are undertaking studies and making preparations (\\\\*3) for the development of a next-generation air mobility business, including participation in the \"Public-Private Committee for Advanced Air Mobility, Air Mobility Revolution and Social Implementation – The Osaka Roundtable (\\\\*4), which positions Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan as a milestone toward the social implementation of air mobility services.\\n\\n>The establishment of Soracle will leverage the strengths of both companies. This includes Sumitomo Corporation’s airline industry network and the expertise it has built up through diversified business activities and JAL’s expertise in safe air transport operations. The new company will provide opportunities to further strengthen Sumitomo Corporation and JAL\\'s cooperative relationship, and accelerate their respective air mobility initiatives through the operation of eVTOL services.\\n\\n>Both companies aim to realize the social implementation of safe and reliable eVTOLs, build a transportation network connecting the regions and create new value through mobility in the sky.\\n\\nSo all of this [once planned excitement for JAL and Volocopter](https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2021/10/26/japan-airlines-plans-evtol-operations-from-2025/) is now being shifted to Archer Aviation. What else may become shifted to Archer in the Asian Markets? \\n\\n**October 26, 2021**\\n\\n>JAL said that eVTOL “is expected to play an active role in a wide range of fields, such as Air Taxi services, emergency lifesaving and disaster response, taking advantage of its mobility similar to that of a helicopter”.\\n\\n>“JAL, as a professional aviation company, aims to create a prosperous and sustainable society through safe and secure comprehensive air mobility operations,” the carrier continued.\\n\\n>“Utilizing our expertise in air mobility operations, we will provide next-generation transportation and mobility infrastructure that meets the needs of local communities, and promote initiatives to achieve the SDGs while solving local issues in areas such as disaster response and medical care.”\\n\\n>Last year Japan Airlines signed a cooperation agreement with German aircraft manufacturer Volocopter (pictured) “to promote the development of the Urban Air Mobility industry for next generation air transportation options of passengers and goods”.\\n\\nWaiting for this news to break any day now. \\n\\nI am building shares at the current cost basis of $2.85 and \\\\~$3.10.

The robotaxi is a purpose-built autonomous vehicle, lacking a steering wheel or pedals, meaning it will need approval from regulators before going into production.\\n\\n.\\n.\\n\\n2. Tesla plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year, with the Cybercab production by 2026 — although he said it could be as late as 2027. \\n\\n.\\n.\\n\\n3. Tesla is developing the Optimus robot, which could be available for $20,000-$30,000, and is capable of performing various tasks.\\n\\n\\n.\\n.\\n\\n4. Cybercab was revealed the prototype robotaxi at Tesla\\'s \"We, Robot” event held at the Warner Bros. film lot in Burbank, California, with a lot of non-public roads for the demonstration. \\n\\n\\n.\\n.\\n\\n5. Tesla has reportedly been mapping the area in advance of the demonstration, even though the company says it doesn\\'t rely on high-definition maps to power its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assist feature\\n\\n\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n\\n\\nTESLA VS WAYMO : KEY DIFFERENCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND APPROACH \\n\\n\\n\\n.\\n.\\n\\n1. Sensing the World:\\n\\n -  - Waymo\\'s Multi-Sensor Fusion:  Waymo uses a suite of sensors that work together. This is like having multiple senses.\\n\\n\\nI. Lidar:  Acts like super-precise radar, creating a 3D \"point cloud\" of the surroundings. This excels in low-light and complex environments.\\n\\nII. Radar: Detects objects and their speed, even in rain or fog.\\n   \\n\\nIII. Cameras: Provide visual information for recognizing objects like traffic lights and pedestrians.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n- - Tesla\\'s Vision-Only System: Tesla relies heavily on cameras, believing that they can provide enough data for AI to understand the world like humans do.\\n\\n\\nI. Neural Networks:  Tesla uses powerful AI to process the visual data from cameras.\\n\\n\\nII. No Lidar:  Tesla famously excludes lidar, arguing it\\'s expensive and unnecessary.\\n\\n\\n- Why this matters:  Lidar provides highly accurate depth and distance data, which is crucial for navigating complex situations. Tesla\\'s vision-only approach is more ambitious but may struggle in conditions where cameras are less effective (e.g., heavy rain, fog).\\n\\n\\n\\n.\\n.\\n\\n\\n2. Understanding the Environment:\\n\\nI. Waymo\\'s HD Maps: Waymo creates incredibly detailed 3D maps of the areas where its vehicles operate. These maps include road geometry, lane markings, traffic signs, and even the positions of trees and buildings.\\n\\n\\nII.  Localization: This allows Waymo\\'s cars to precisely locate themselves within the map, even in challenging conditions.\\n\\n\\nIII. Predictability:  Maps help anticipate what\\'s coming and plan routes accordingly.\\n\\n\\nIV.  Tesla\\'s Real-Time Learning: Tesla relies less on pre-mapped environments. Its AI learns to interpret the world in real-time, based on the data it gathers from its cameras.\\n\\n\\nV. Generalization: The goal is to create a system that can drive anywhere, not just in pre-mapped areas.\\n\\n\\nVI. Adaptability: Tesla\\'s system can potentially adapt to new environments and situations more quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\n- - Why this matters: Waymo\\'s HD maps provide a high level of certainty in known areas, but mapping is expensive and time-consuming. Tesla\\'s approach is more scalable but relies heavily on the AI\\'s ability to correctly interpret complex scenes.\\n\\n\\n\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n\\n3. Deployment Strategies:\\n\\nI. Waymo\\'s Gradual Rollout: Waymo has focused on deploying its robotaxi service in specific cities, starting with Phoenix. This allows for careful testing and refinement in controlled environments.\\n\\n\\nII.  Safety First:  Waymo prioritizes safety and has a strong track record.\\n\\nIII.  Controlled Expansion:  They expand their service area gradually as they gain confidence in their technology.\\n\\n\\n\\n IV.  Tesla\\'s Beta Testing: Tesla has released its Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software to a wider group of drivers. This allows them to gather vast amounts of real-world driving data.\\n\\n\\nV.  Rapid Iteration:  Tesla can quickly improve its system through frequent software updates.\\n\\n\\n VI. Driver Responsibility:  FSD is still a driver-assist system, and drivers are expected to remain vigilant and take over when necessary.\\n\\n\\n- -  Why this matters: Waymo\\'s approach is more cautious, prioritizing safety and controlled testing. Tesla\\'s approach is faster and more agile, but it also carries more risk, as evidenced by accidents involving FSD.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese are some of the core differences between Waymo and Tesla\\'s approach to self-driving. Both companies are pushing the boundaries of technology, but their philosophies and strategies are quite distinct. It will be fascinating to see how these approaches evolve in the years to come.\\n\\n\\n\\n. . . . . .  . \\n\\n\\nEDIT:  THE MUSK PARADOX \\n\\n\\nThe entire Tesla brand is highly dependent on Elon. Essentially Elon is Tesla. A lot of the Tesla Brand value is tied up with Elon Musk the human.\\n\\nThis wasn\\'t a problem in the past when Elon seemed like a nerd who just loved tech and posted memes.\\n\\nFast forward to 2024, the guy is full blow republican (not saying it\\'s bad or good). He is actively involved with politics.\\n\\nIMO, He\\'s too busy \"owning the libs\" and fighting cultural wars (\"woke virus\"). \\n\\nNow combine this with his other behavioral problems like self administration of ketamine and using other drugs, and we have a recipe for disaster.\\n\\n\\nFYI, I\\'m not an Elon Hater. I used to admire him and it\\'s sad to watch his downfall.\\n\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\nTLDR;\\n\\n\\nIMO, the event was Very Disappointing. \\n\\nElon announced (NOT ACTUALLY LAUNCHED) basically what he has been promising for years (TRUE AUTONOMY AKA FSD).\\n\\nIt was no different than the previous announcements of FSD and Cybertruk.\\n\\nI expect delays (regulatory approvals and the actual tech being ready).\\n\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\n\\n\\n. . . . . \\n\\n\\nUPDATE :\\n\\n. . . . . \\n\\nFor all the regards who don\\'t understand what WAYMO actually is, I just did another post analyzing Google (the owner of Waymo) and why they\\'re the number 1 player in AI, robotics and self driving.\\n\\n. . .\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/d3tSIKLRIJ'}, {'text': 'I did some digging because I felt [my previous DD on Archer Aviation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1for7pv/the_time_has_come_for_archer_aviation_achr_evtol/) wasn\\'t to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information.

When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in.\\n\\nArcher Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He\\'s just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF.\\n\\nIn the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a \\\\~19% and \\\\~22% short  in the eVTOL startups respectively.\\n\\nSince we\\'re here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe\\'s such as, \"outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’\" or \"Joby will be a historical footnote\" or Grizzly\\'s \"Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck\" or “metaphoric crash landing”.\\n\\nHarsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let\\'s see what Grizzly\\'s thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written.\\n\\n[Grizzly\\'s article you can read for yourself](https://grizzlyreports.com/we-believe-archer-aviation-inc-nasdaqachr-is-a-lame-duck/) but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023):\\n\\n1. **Misleading DoD contract:**\\n   * **Claim**: Archer’s **DoD contract** was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a **noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract**, with only **$1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023**, far less significant than portrayed.\\n   * **Reference**: \"DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023.\"\\n2. **Flight Activity Misrepresentation:**\\n   * **Claim**: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a **handful of flights**, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress.\\n   * **Reference**: \"Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights.\"\\n3. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants:**\\n   * **Claim**: Archer’s partnerships with **United Airlines** and **Stellantis** were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant.\\n   * **Reference**: \"ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation.\"\\n4. **FAA Certification Timeline:**\\n   * **Claim**: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive **Type Certification** for its Midnight aircraft until at least **2028**, not 2024 as Archer claimed.\\n   * **Reference**: \"FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate.\"\\n5. **Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing:**\\n   * **Claim**: Archer settled a legal dispute with **Wisk/Boeing** by giving **$100 million in free shares** to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims.\\n   * **Reference**: \"ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing.\"\\n6. **Incomplete Manufacturing Facility:**\\n   * **Claim**: Archer promised its **San Jose lab and small-scale production facility** would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines.\\n   * **Reference**: \"Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023.\"\\n7. **Stock Dilution and Early Vesting:**\\n   * **Claim**: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing **free shares to partners** like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders\\' expense.\\n   * **Reference**: \"ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early.\"\\n\\nAll these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It\\'s easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it.\\n\\nLet\\'s take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today\\'s date 9/28/2024.\\n\\n1. **\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*Misleading DoD contract:**\\n   * **Reality**: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft.\\n      1. **Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight** eVTOL aircraft to the **U.S. Air Force** as part of its **$142 million contract** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer\\'s partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results.\\n      2. **Use of Aircraft**: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for **personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations**, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also **pilot training, maintenance, and certification support**, further validating the value of the contract\\n2. **\\\\*Flight Activity Misrepresentation:**\\n   * **Reality**: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they \"saw anything\" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren\\'t doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report.\\n      1. **Ongoing Flight Testing**: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the **Midnight** eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly\\'s claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed **daily test flights** in preparation for their **FAA certification** and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested\\u200b.\\n      2. **Video Footage Authenticity**: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the **U.S. Air Force\\'s Agility Prime program**, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing.\\n3. **\\\\*\\\\*Partnerships with Cheap Warrants:**\\n   * **Reality**: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly\\'s thesis full of criticisms of Archer\\'s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments.\\n      1. **United Airlines** has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In **August 2023**, United was part of a **$215 million investment** round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a **$10 million pre-delivery payment** for 100 of Archer\\'s eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft\\u200b.\\n      2. **Stellantis**, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In **January 2023**, Stellantis committed **$150 million in equity** and began scaling up its role as Archer\\'s exclusive manufacturing partner for the **Midnight eVTOL**. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer.\\n      3. **Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024**, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million.\\n4. **\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*FAA Certification Timeline:**\\n   * **Reality**: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn\\'t seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification.\\n      1. **Significant FAA Milestones Achieved**: Archer has made substantial progress in its **FAA certification** pathway: **Final Airworthiness Criteria**: On **May 23, 2024**, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the **FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria** for the **Midnight** aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification\\u200b. **Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate** and **Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate**: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations\\n      2. **For-Credit Flight Testing**: As of **September 2024**, Archer successfully completed **402 test flights**. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for **for-credit flight testing**, which is expected to begin in **early 2024**\\u200b.\\n      3. **Delivery to the U.S. Air Force**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight aircraft** to the **U.S. Air Force** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company\\'s technical progress.\\n      4. **Part 135 Certification**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight aircraft** to the **U.S. Air Force** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company\\'s technical progress.\\n5. **\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing:**\\n   * **Reality**: Grizzly makes the argument Archer\\'s settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk\\'s autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What\\'s actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it\\'s like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn\\'t a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them.\\n      1. **Collaboration Instead of Defeat**: The settlement has evolved into a **collaboration agreement** between Archer and Wisk, with **Boeing** as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become **Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology**. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer\\'s technological capabilities for future aircraft.\\n      2. **Boeing Investment**: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a **significant investment** in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like **Stellantis** and **United Airlines**. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome.\\n6. **\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*Incomplete Manufacturing Facility:**\\n   * **Reality**: Grizzly\\'s early criticisms of Archer\\'s manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities\\' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis.\\n      1. **San Jose Facility**: Archer completed the installation of its **high-volume battery pack manufacturing line** at the **San Jose Integrated Test Lab** in **May 2024**. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to **15,000 battery packs per year**, a crucial step toward scaling production\\u200b.\\n      2. **Conforming Midnight Aircraft**: Archer’s **first conforming Midnight aircraft** is expected to be completed in **Q4 2023**, with flight testing set to begin in **early 2024**. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress\\u200b.\\n      3. **Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility**: In addition, Archer began construction on a **high-volume manufacturing facility** in **Covington, Georgia** in **March 2023**. This facility, projected to support the production of up to **650 eVTOL aircraft per year**, is on track for completion in **2024**, ahead of the **Midnight** eVTOL’s planned entry into service in **2025**. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to **complete construction by the end of the year** as of July 2024.\\n7. **\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*Stock Dilution and Early Vesting:**\\n   * **Reality**: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis.\\n      1. **Stellantis Partnership**: Since **August 2023**, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing **$55 million** following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to **650 aircraft annually** once their **Covington, Georgia** facility is operational\\u200b. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders.\\n      2. **Wisk/Boeing Settlement**: The **Boeing/Wisk** settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to **autonomy technology**, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a **$215 million** funding round, which included other major investors like **United Airlines** and **ARK Invest**. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs.\\n\\nAs you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision.\\n\\nIf you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported.\\n\\nHere are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xdgt42wvnmrd1.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=03e74db783587a8c3b4bf1d44326a0d5ced3c474\\n\\nMy theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute.\\n\\nI am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it\\'s 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify.\\n\\nWhile the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation\\'s Air-Mobility aspirations.\\n\\nThis is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can\\'t wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it\\'s the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft.\\n\\nWith the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares.\\n\\nCurrently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information.\\n\\n**Update**: [Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-achr-percent-advance-2024-09-27/).\\n\\nA number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a \"buy\" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an \"overweight\" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an \"overweight\" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a \"buy\" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from [MarketBeat.com](http://MarketBeat.com), Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of \"Moderate Buy\" and a consensus target price of $9.00.\\n\\n**Update 2**: [This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule](https://verticalmag.com/news/faa-soon-to-release-final-sfar-for-powered-lift-aircraft):\\n\\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation.\\n\\nSpeaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.”\\n\\n“I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to \\\\[industry\\\\] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.”\\n\\nThe SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices.\\n\\nMany in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range.\\n\\nHowever, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR.  \\n“There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver \\\\[the rule\\\\] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.”\\n\\nWhile Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16.

He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA)\\xa0new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it.\\n\\nNvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\\n\\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\\n\\nAt Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\\n\\nOf course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\\n\\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\\xa0[**Q2 2024 investor letter**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/heres-why-nvidia-corporation-nvda-appreciated-in-q2-1346747/):\\n\\n>\\n\\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp\\xa0(NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled\\xa0[**Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/top-10-ai-stocks-to-watch-after-latest-earnings-and-analyst-ratings-1350954/).

Airlines are also extremely capital-intensive and require large amounts of debt to finance their Boeing and Airbus fleets. This leads to large interest payments that further narrow margins. The large amount of debt also increases equity volatility, causing airline stocks to be more volatile.

The graph has long stretches of both bullish and bearish runs; to be profitable a trader will seek to time entries into long and shorts within the transition period between bearish and bullish, maximizing\\xa0exposure to\\xa0the longer-term trend. My thesis is that we are currently in one of these transition periods.\\xa0\\n\\nThe red, blue, and gold lines represent the 20, 50, and 200 MA on the daily chart, respectively. We use a combination of three bullish signals to propose a long entry:\\xa0\\n\\n* Signal 1: A downward trending 20MA crosses upward trending DAL on the daily chart\\xa0\\n   * Out of the 11 occurrences in the past 3 years (red events), DAL has continued a bullish trend 10/11 (91%) times\\xa0\\n   * Red event 4 is the only event that fails this signal, while red event 8 lead the bullish run by 1-2 months\\xa0\\n   * In the past year, there has been 3 such occurrences, and DAL has continued a bullish trend 100% of the time\\xa0\\n   * The last occurrence was 2 weeks ago\\xa0\\n* Signal 2: A downward trending 50MA crosses upward trending DAL on the daily chart, typically following signal 2 after 1-3 weeks\\xa0\\n   * Out of the 7 occurrences in the past 3 years (blue events), DAL has continued a bullish trend 7/7 (100%) times\\xa0\\n   * The 8th occurrence was yesterday\\xa0\\n* Signal 3: An upward trending 200MA crosses a faster, upward trending DAL on the daily chart, typically following signal 2 after 1-3 weeks\\xa0\\n   * Out of the 2 occurrences in the past 2 years (yellow events), DAL has continued a long bullish trend 2/2 (100%) times\\xa0\\n   * The 200MA has begun trending upward post COVID since April 2023 and continues its momentum\\xa0\\n   * The 3^(rd) occurrence will likely be within the next 2 weeks\\n\\nThese three signals consecutively have signaled strong bullish trends lasting 2-5 months representing 46% and 40% returns, respectively (34-50 and (34-50 and 38-53). We are now sitting at 42, with these three signals poised to align again. The current RSI14 is not high or low but rising, indicating growing momentum. However, we may be cautionary due to the lower-than-average trading volume during the past 2-3 weeks.\\xa0\\n\\nTaken together, we project a conservative price target of 56, representing 34% return, within the next 4 months.\\xa0\\n\\nNow, before we lose our entire portfolio, let's turn to the fundamentals, as just looking at technical signals is like driving a car by only looking through the rear-view mirror.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**Fundamental Analysis**\\xa0\\n\\nDespite the underperforming and highly competitive airlines industry, Delta is well positioned in the industry. Competition and strategic differentiation by price currently favor premium airlines (see: [Budget Airlines Want to Go Premium. That’s Easier Said Than Done.](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/budget-airlines-premium-perks-245a1d61)) As other airlines struggle to compete, Delta can capture a larger percentage of the total market in the short term. As a premium airline with brand strength, Delta’s pricing power will remain until its competitors can effectively compete on quality and experience.\\xa0\\n\\nFurthermore, the airline industry has excess capacity as airlines were overly optimistic about demand forecasts post-COVID. As volume players correct overexpansion of routes while shifting away from volume towards quality, we can expect more rational price discipline and subsequent price premiums (and margins) to increase. While 90% of corporations do not expect corporate air travel demand to soften ([Delta Air Lines, Inc. - Delta Air Lines Announces June Quarter 2024 Financial Results)](https://ir.delta.com/news/news-details/2024/Delta-Air-Lines-Announces-June-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx), slowing growth coupled with higher ROIC is preferable to value destruction; Delta’s key ratios ([DAL (Delta Air Lines) 1-Year ROIIC % (gurufocus.com),](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/roiic-1y/DAL) [DAL | Overview (valueinvesting.io)](https://valueinvesting.io/DAL/overview)) show ROIC strength compared to industry peers, as well as ROIC higher than cost of capital.\\xa0\\n\\nFuel cost impacts on margin may also trend favorably for airlines, as oil prices drop in the short term. With the markets potentially pricing in a Trump presidency, we may see fuel-cost tailwinds for Delta.\\xa0\\n\\nAnother short-term consideration has been the CrowdStrike outage; while investors have been pricing in the revenue hit, the scale and timeline of Delta’s recovery is still in speculation.\\xa0Known for their operational prowess, this one-time, one-week fiasco is unlikely to have changed much except for the direct revenue hit. This event may have led to DAL being oversold in the short term (2 weeks ago). \\xa0\\n\\nA 5-year growth-exit DCF valuation gives a fair value of 64, well above our price target of 56 from earlier:\\xa0[Delta DCF Valuation | Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL) (valueinvesting.io)](https://valueinvesting.io/DAL/valuation/dcf-growth-exit-5y)\\xa0\\n\\n* Above model makes reasonable revenue growth assumptions\\xa0\\n   * Model projects DAL revenue CAGR of 4.77%\\xa0\\n      * Past 15 years, DAL revenue CAGR is 5.75%, or 6.24% removing COVID years\\xa0\\n      * Growth projection supported by DAL 200MA\\xa0\\n   * CAPEX assumptions are reasonable (11% consistent with historical)\\xa0\\n   * Terminal growth rate of 0.5%, Terminal Value 75% of EV – reasonable\\xa0\\n      * US population growth of 0.4% but trending downward\\xa0\\n      * US GDP growth 2-3%\\xa0\\n   * Airline industry unlikely to be replaced in the next decades\\xa0\\n* Note: if you check out the other valuation models at the above link, all but the earnings power value model forecasts a much higher fair value than the current price of 42\\xa0\\n   * This is due to the earnings power value model being reliant on historical earnings, which are heavily skewed due to COVID in 2020 and 2021\\xa0\\n\\nOther notes:\\xa0\\n\\n* Delta’s fleet is 40% airbus, making it less exposed to Boeing than other airlines\\xa0\\n* Recent US Dept.

Some of you regards might say that \"OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED\", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY.\\n\\nFirst of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are \"worth now\".\\n\\n|Name|Stock price|EPS|SP/EPS ratio|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|AAPL|230|1,4|164|\\n|MSFT|413|2,95|140|\\n|AMD|145|0,16|1.035|\\n|META|516|5,16|100|\\n|AMZN|171|1,26|135|\\n|NVDA|116|0,68|170|\\n\\nAs you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price.\\n\\nBut before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list.\\n\\n## AAPL\\n\\nLatest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits.\\n\\nHow do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new.\\n\\nBut this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo \"Vision Pro\" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more.\\n\\n## MSFT\\n\\nThey did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a \"everything\" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are.\\n\\nThey are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy.\\n\\nThey are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office?\\n\\n## AMD\\n\\nI am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first.\\n\\nAlso, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware.\\n\\nEven if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software.\\n\\nAnd no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU\\'s). I will get on this in NVDA\\'s section.\\n\\n## META\\n\\nThey are a \"AD\" company, just like Google. They have some \"long game\" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value.\\n\\nALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS.\\n\\n## AMZN\\n\\nThe \"everything company\". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL.\\n\\n# NVDA\\n\\nAND OUR STAR CHILD.\\nHOT TOPIC OF 2024.\\nTHE FUTURE OF THE WORLD.\\n\\nDo you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue.\\n\\nSo why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU\\'s of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace.\\n\\nRemember what I told you in AAPL\\'s section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now?\\n\\nH100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell.\\n\\nAnd I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU\\'s because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company.\\n\\nRemember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?\\n\\nLet the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war.\\n\\nEDIT: forgor some words'}, {'text': '(tl;dr SAVA is a sell)\\n\\n**Introduction**\\n\\nCassava Sciences ($SAVA), a small clinical-stage biotech company, is focused on neurodegenerative diseases, with its lead asset, Simufilam, a small molecule pill undergoing pre-clinical and early clinical testing for Alzheimer\\'s disease. In our\\xa0initial coverage of Cassava (SA, Nov. 2023), we delved into the drug and its clinical data, noting that despite the \"promising\" results, the numerous inconsistencies, questionable reporting, and the ongoing legal challenges left us cautious, opting to remain on the sidelines until more clarity emerged. Recent developments, including the\\xa0[unraveling story of Dr. Wang](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/professor-charged-operating-multimillion-dollar-grant-fraud-scheme)—an author on all Simufilam-related publications listed on Cassava\\'s website—have only heightened our skepticism. With key executives stepping down and phase 3 topline readouts on the horizon, we find it prudent to reexamine the situation and share our updated perspective.\\n\\n**Thesis**\\n\\nThe core assertion repeatedly emphasized by former CEO Remi Barbier and echoed by many analysts was that \"biomarkers do not lie\" ([8:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgbhzzPaQwg&t=20s)). However, with the validity of the phase 1 and 2 data reported by Cassava now under scrutiny—particularly following the fraud charges against Dr. Wang—the alleged efficacy observed in open-label trials, as well as the drug\\'s mechanism of action (MOA) and its impact on Alzheimer\\'s disease pathology, is, in our view, increasingly in doubt.\\n\\nThe abrupt departure of Barbier, the CEO and founder, along with the SVP of Neuroscience, in the wake of these charges, is far from reassuring. Barbier, who appears to identify with Simufilam’s early-stage research (\"we started working on our drug\", \"yes, we did come up with a small molecule\") ([3:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8ipamyLuuQ&t=1392s);\\xa0[6:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SIqNWbPCFE&t=6s)), exited the company with no parting words but did secure a $1.2M severance package. Moreover, the potential settlement concerning legal action with the SEC, estimated at $40M, raises further concerns. This potential liability, though not final, could significantly harm the company’s credibility and further strain its capital reserves. The exact exposure could be smaller, greater, or nonexistent, but based on available facts and disclosures, caution is warranted.\\n\\nWe remain skeptical of Simufilam\\'s efficacy. In our initial report, we highlighted several unanswered questions, despite the seemingly promising data. As the thesis surrounding the drug begins to unravel and the new executive team promises full transparency and timely publication of study data—now to be assessed by third-party statisticians—we believe that the drug\\'s chances of success are slim. The fundamentals have shifted significantly, a reality we believe the current valuation does not adequately reflect.\\n\\n**Wang**\\xa0\\n\\nDr. Wang, the scientist responsible for the majority of early-stage Simufilam research and an advisor to Cassava Sciences,\\xa0[was issued an indictment on June 27th](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/professor-charged-operating-multimillion-dollar-grant-fraud-scheme), just five weeks after the company announced\\xa0[cash bonus awards for its executive officers](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1069530/000143774924018029/sava20240521_8k.htm). The indictment alleges that from May 2015 through approximately April 2023, Dr. Wang was involved in a scheme of data fabrication and falsification related to NIH grant applications, purportedly benefiting both himself and Cassava Sciences. Allegedly, the fraudulent grant funds, which totaled $16M between 2017 and 2021, were used for research on treatments and diagnostic testing for Alzheimer\\'s disease, including Simufilam. While the indictment mentions that Wang\\'s work related to phase 1 and phase 2 developments, it provides no specific details. Just three days after the indictment,\\xa0[Cassava issued an 8K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1069530/000149315224025725/form8-k.htm)\\xa0disclosing an ongoing Department of Justice (DOJ) and SEC investigation involving\\xa0*two senior employees,*\\xa0updates on Dr. Wang\\'s situation, and additional information regarding prior data statements from the phase 2b study of Simufilam.\\n\\nCassava introduces Dr. Wang as a CUNY professor, former scientific collaborator, and advisor who, along with Dr. Lindsay Burns (SVP Neuroscience, [who shares surname “Barbier” with the former CEO here](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadBasicPdf/12065440?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiJjYzk1MjJiZC1jZjc2LTQ3NGItYjBkNC03NzhiMTUzYmRiOGMiLCJ2ZXIiOiJiOTA0YWE3Ny0xOWI2LTRkMTMtYTBiNS03NjI5ZmUzMmE5MDAiLCJleHAiOjB9)), discovered Simufilam. In addition to his early work on Simufilam, Dr. Wang’s lab conducted the final analysis of phase 2b data. Notably, Cassava terminated its consulting relationship with Dr. Wang and removed him from the Cash Incentive Plan before the indictment was issued.\\n\\nThe most significant disclosure is that an internal investigation revealed that an email sent by a senior Cassava employee to Dr. Wang before the analysis may have unblinded him to some participant data, particularly regarding the reported statistically significant changes in CSF biomarkers. Interestingly, in a\\xa0[2021 10K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001069530/000106953022000011/sava-20211231x10k.htm), Cassava reported:\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“A consulting biostatistician conducted an independent analysis of the data set. However, in May 2020, we announced that an outside lab with whom we had no prior work experience conducted a bioanalysis of CSF samples from our Phase 2b study. The data set from this initial bioanalysis showed unnaturally high variability and other problems. Overall, we believe data from the initial bioanalysis can be interpreted as anomalous and highly improbable. With its validity in question, we believe the initial bioanalysis serves no useful purpose. Backup CSF samples were subsequently sent to City University of New York (CUNY) for bioanalysis. All bioanalyses were conducted under blinded conditions to eliminate any possibility of bias.”\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nIn essence, the company sent the data to an independent biostatistician, which reportedly yielded highly variable results, but after transferring the data to Wang’s lab—where there is now speculation about possible unblinding—the analysis showed that \"Simufilam significantly (P<0.05) improved an entire panel of biomarkers of disease in patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared to a placebo group.\" While this is still speculative, the initial analysis, which showed \"problems,\" in our opinion, now seems arguably more credible in light of recent developments.\\n\\nThe supplemental disclosure clarifies that the CANTAB measurements reported by Cassava were not prepared by Wang or his lab. However, the company provided an update on the\\xa0*post hoc*\\xa0methodology they used in the analysis, noting that this information was previously available in a draft preprint manuscript as of Q1 2021. That said, the figures presented by the company and reported in our previous article did not specify the sample size. As we previously noted, there were inconsistencies regarding dose-response and possible confounding due to questionable inclusion criteria. The company reports that only Spatial Working Memory and Episodic Memory were included, even though other outcome measurements were generated but not reported. This approach could create issues with multiple hypothesis testing, especially given the short period on the drug, but that is not even the most relevant concern. The episodic memory test excluded about 42% of the participants (38% in the 50mg group, 52% in the 100mg group, and 36% in the placebo group). The 8K does not disclose percentages for spatial working memory, but the figures presented featured 14/13/10 and 22/17/18 patients for placebo/50mg/100mg in both tests, respectively. Clearly, the exclusion rates are high and potentially favor the drug arms, with fewer patients being excluded from the placebo arm. Needless to say, this does not inspire confidence, especially considering that the results were not statistically significant, as the sponsor claimed the study was not powered to detect a difference. Whether one agrees with the rationale for exclusion or not, the company should have disclosed the full set of results alongside the smaller analysis-set population.\\n\\nMany questions remain, but the picture is slowly coming into focus. The notoriously “infallible” biomarkers now seem to offer doubtful insight to shareholders. While Cassava has shed some light on the phase 2b data, the indictment alleges that Wang may have falsified claims related to the \"phase 1 and phase 2\" stages of development. Currently, there are no specific details on what has or has not been altered or falsified, if at all. However, considering that all of the research published on Cassava’s website about Simufilam was authored or co-authored by Wang, little can be taken for granted at this point.\\n\\nIt is, however, crucial to emphasize that an indictment signifies only that there is\\xa0*at least*\\xa0sufficient evidence to believe that a particular person has committed an offense; it does not equate to a determination of guilt. Probable cause is a low threshold and does not imply guilt; it merely indicates that there is enough evidence to justify further proceedings. Ultimately, the determination of guilt or innocence will rest on the jury\\'s interpretation of the evidence in court, where the standard of proof is \\'beyond a reasonable doubt.\\' At this juncture, public knowledge is limited to the company’s disclosure that Wang may have been potentially unblinded to the phase 2b biomarker data his lab was processing, but so far, there is no direct claim of any data alteration.\\n\\n**Barbier and Burns**\\xa0\\n\\nJust two weeks after the 8K update mentioned earlier was posted on the SEC website, on July 17th,\\xa0[Cassava Sciences issued another 8K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1069530/000143774924022876/sava20240717_8k.htm), announcing the departure and appointment of key executives. Most notably, Remi Barbier, the CEO, resigned for “\\\\[reasons\\\\] other than for cause,\" a legal term indicating termination of employment without any fault on the employee\\'s part. Barbier also stepped down from his role as chairman of the board of directors. Until the effective date of his resignation, Barbier will remain with the company in a non-executive capacity, devoid of duties or responsibilities, and will receive severance compensation amounting to $1.23M. Concurrent with Barbier\\'s departure, Dr. Lindsay Burns, the SVP of Neuroscience and a co-author of many Simufilam papers with Dr. Wang, will also step down. However, she will continue to provide \"consulting services\" to Cassava for a one-year period. The company reserves the right to terminate the $500/hour consulting agreement if Burns engages in any action that would \"discredit\" Cassava. Like Barbier, Burns is also entitled to severance compensation, totaling $0.5M.\\n\\nUntil the company identifies and permanently hires a new CEO, Richard J. Barry, an independent director, will serve as executive chairman and principal executive officer. Barry, who has been on Cassava\\'s board since 2021, has leadership experience from Sarepta Therapeutics and MiMedx Group, and has been involved in various investment management enterprises. He holds a Bachelor of Arts from Pennsylvania State University. The 8-K filing was accompanied by a\\xa0[press release](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-announces-changes-executive-leadership-enhanced), which mostly restated the disclosures from the 8-K with some additional comments from Barry, but also included one additional piece of information. At the bottom of the announcement, a note regarding contact information states:\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**“For more information:**\\n\\n**Sitrick And Company 1-800-550-7521**\\n\\n[**Mike\\\\_Sitrick@Sitrick.com**](mailto:Mike_Sitrick@Sitrick.com)\\n\\n**Seth Lubove:**\\xa0[**slubove@sitrick.com**](mailto:slubove@sitrick.com)\\n\\n**NY:Rich Wilner:**\\xa0[**rwilner@sitrick.com**](mailto:rwilner@sitrick.com)\\xa0**800-699-1481”**\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMichael Sitrick is a\\xa0[world-renowned public relations consultant](https://www.sitrick.com/about-us/michael-s-sitrick/), known for providing some of the best and most expensive services, with an\\xa0[alleged rate of $1100/hour\\xa0](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/the-master-of-spin.php)(in 2019). Bringing Sitrick on board is definitely a wise decision (disregarding the financial considerations), as he is one of the best in his craft, with clients such as Roy Disney, Food Lion, Metabolife, and Patricia Dunn. Notably, Allied Capital, once investigated by the SEC, Office of Inspector General, and DOJ, amidst the investigations and persistent critique,\\xa0[hired Sitrick](https://www.sitrick.com/clients/). While this move may seem strategic, it\\'s not necessarily a positive sign. Hiring a PR consulting firm with Sitrick\\'s expertise often indicates the need to manage a significant issue. This development alone should prompt a careful reconsideration of the situation, even without considering the other recent facts. That being said, we acknowledge that moving forward, the structure of Cassava\\'s information flow to the public will be carefully planned and tailored—an important consideration.\\n\\nAbout a week after the announcement of changes in the executive team structure, on July 21st, Barry\\xa0[issued a letter to stakeholders](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1069530/000143774924023128/sava20240721_8k.htm). In the letter, he reflects on his personal experience with Alzheimer\\'s Disease, how it has affected his life, and shares his philosophy for leading Cassava.\\n\\nBarry’s understanding of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is rooted in \"months \\\\[of\\\\] getting a better understanding\" by \"looking at the company’s clinical data, speaking with experts, and visiting Austin.\" He acknowledged what any rational individual would recognize in the world of publicly traded companies—it’s not about silencing “loud” skeptics, but about sticking to the fundamentals and developing products that bring value to shareholders (Cassava dropped short lawsuits in early 2024). Engaging in open discussions with short sellers who provide critique and foster discourse can only benefit a company that is fundamentally sound. However, Barry’s comparison of Cassava’s clinical trials to “Columbus setting sail from Spain in 1492” and the skeptics of that time, while perhaps intended to be inspirational, comes off as a bizarre analogy.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the letter does not delve deeply into the rationale behind Simufilam or address any of the current inconsistencies or the extent of Dr. Wang’s alleged fraud that could have a factual impact on Simufilam’s mechanism of action and early data. Instead of offering “several pages … \\\\[of\\\\] reasons that I \\\\[Barry\\\\] believe Cassava’s Alzheimer’s drug candidate, Simufilam, could be successful,” Barry opts for a baseball analogy, which, while perhaps more relatable for an unseasoned investor, leaves those seeking detailed explanations wanting more.\\n\\nBarry also notes that with the change in leadership, the company has made several \"commitments.\" These include a promise of scientific rigor, honest transparency, and a commitment to informing the community of material news, whether “favorable or unfavorable.” Additionally, he mentioned that the phase 3 programs are being executed by Premier Research, which will hold the data and transfer it directly to the biostatisticians at Pentara Corporation, the firm that previously managed the CTAD open-label randomized withdrawal Simufilam study. We will briefly refer to the CTAD study and Pentara in a later section.\\n\\nIt is perplexing that, amid an ongoing investigation into two senior officers and allegations of fraud, both the CEO and the SVP of Neuroscience have stepped down with the vague explanation of \"not for cause.\" At present, no definitive statements have been made, and the apparent connection between these events could be coincidental. However, with the involvement of Sitrick, the lack of clarification on the extent of the alleged fraudulent early developments of Simufilam, and the abrupt managerial changes, the situation at Cassava appears rather precarious. On August 1st, Cassava announced they would hold a conference call to \"discuss recent developments and provide a company update,\" which we will review in detail infra.\\n\\n**Conference Call**\\xa0\\n\\n[The conference call](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-hold-conference-call-discuss-recent)\\xa0largely reiterated information from recent 8-Ks and press releases but also touched on several new topics. Barry initially reviewed the previously communicated timeline, with phase 3 results for Rethink-Alz expected by the end of December 2024 and for Refocus-Alz by mid-2025. He also briefly mentioned the topic of warrants, with more details provided later in the call by the CFO. Perhaps the most significant update was regarding the potential SEC settlement related to the investigation that began a couple of years ago following the citizen petition. Management commented that while they could not disclose much, they anticipate that if a settlement were reached, it would likely amount to approximately $40 million and \"end the investigation.\" According to the company, this figure is only an estimate. During the Q&A session, more context was given about the investigation, with Barry noting that the SEC\\'s primary concern revolves around the company\\'s 2021 fundraising. Company filings from that period detail a sale of around 4 million shares at $49 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $190M.\\n\\nBarry also discussed increased spending associated with preparing for the potential future launch of the drug. While planning for a post-approval ramp-up is prudent, it seems premature for a company with no phase 3 data and a recent indictment of the scientist responsible for much of the early-stage research. The extension of the open-label period was another topic addressed, which the company claims was in response to patient demand for continued treatment, pending phase 3 readouts or drug approval. While this demand could be seen as a positive indicator of perceived improvements, it\\'s equally plausible that it reflects the drug\\'s relative safety, regardless of efficacy. Simufilam has been characterized as \"safe\" in early trials, a point of divergence where optimists view this as a significant accomplishment, while skeptics suggest it may indicate a lack of efficacy. Currently, we view this extension as not materially indicative of drug efficacy.\\n\\nInteresting notes on the phase 3 trials came from the CMO, Dr. Kupiec, who discussed the statistical analysis plan. He mentioned that the analysis would follow the mITT (modified intent-to-treat) principle, assessing patients who took the drug and had at least one follow-up. While mITT analysis could potentially be problematic if missed follow-ups in one group are due to toxicity, which could artificially boost the performance of that arm, this concern is mitigated by the fact that the investigative drug is being compared to a placebo and was previously reported as safe. Dr. Kupiec also mentioned that the FDA agrees with the mITT analysis, but later clarified that they are still awaiting FDA commentary on the overall statistical plan, which must be predefined and submitted before data readouts.\\n\\nThe company ended the June quarter with $207M on hand and expects to finish 2024 with approximately $117M to $127M, accounting for the potential $40M settlement. The CFO noted that through the warrant program, the company sold 5.7 million shares, generating proceeds of approximately $126M, and confirmed that there are currently no outstanding warrants.\\n\\n**Simufilam**\\xa0\\n\\nThe primary issue facing Simufilam is the ongoing investigation into the potential misconduct of Dr. Wang. At this time, it\\'s impossible to determine the full extent of his alleged wrongdoing, if any, leaving the analysis open to interpretation—whether one sees the glass as half empty or half full. However, we believe, conservatively, that these troubling circumstances will likely have a material impact, further undermining the already fragile premise of Simufilam\\'s efficacy. We recommend that the reader accesses and studies the [official indictment document](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68898759/united-states-v-wang/) to have an independent opinion.\\n\\nOver the years, the company and its followers have built a narrative centered around the reliability of biomarkers, almost obsessively repeating the mantra that\\xa0[\"Biomarkers are objective biological data. There are no known placebo effects.\"](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001069530/000106953022000011/sava-20211231x10k.htm)\\xa0and \"Biomarkers do not lie.\" Simufilam\\'s proposed mechanism of action aligns perfectly with this narrative, targeting the early stages of Alzheimer\\'s disease, where early-stage patients are said to benefit the most. Conveniently, this group also tends to exhibit the strongest placebo responses and is often starting or continuing treatment with Donepezil or Galantamine. Notably, many investigational Alzheimer\\'s treatments that ultimately showed no benefit in large-scale studies initially appeared effective only in early-stage patients during the early phases of development.\\n\\nCassava\\'s historical comparisons, however, are flawed for several reasons—no two trials involve identical populations. By comparing their open-label data to findings from other studies with differing MMSE inclusion criteria, in our opinion, Cassava has, for unseasoned investors, created an impression of efficacy that remains unproven.\\n\\nRecently, the company emphasized its commitment to transparency and the rigorous standards to which its phase 3 trials will be held, stating that Pentara will oversee the biostatistics. However, [during a presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Z6NeqPPWQ) of the randomized withdrawal study by Pentara\\'s CEO, she was unable to provide details on the use and characteristics of classic symptomatic Alzheimer\\'s drugs in the trial—arguably one of the most critical aspects of an open-label Alzheimer\\'s study (the, now former, SVP Neuroscience also said \"I (Burns) am not sure\" in the background). The presentation included an updated figure of ADAS-Cog scores over time in different groups, yet crucial information about the role of symptomatic drugs remains unaddressed (slide 21). Beyond the glaring issue of missing sample sizes for each group at various time points, the randomized withdrawal study did not achieve statistical significance in either the mild or moderate groups. The company attributed this to the \"disease-modifying\" properties of the drug, but we interpret this more as a lack of efficacy. The figure highlights only the patients who participated in the randomized withdrawal, making comparisons to large cohorts from major trials or cohort studies misleading and unrepresentative. The lines between what is a phase 2 and phase 1 blur, and as mentioned before, smaller sample sizes tend to show promise that rarely is reflected in large scale trials.\\n\\nOverall, the mistrustful critique of Simufilam and its mechanism of action seem increasingly valid, particularly in light of Dr. Wang\\'s indictment on charges of potentially fraudulent claims related to the drug. Given the facts and the likely merit of these charges, we believe that the notion of Simufilam\\'s success is highly improbable. The alleged efficacy is most likely a product of small sample sizes, confounding factors, and exclusions in the statistical analysis, with historical comparisons being largely unjustified. Baseball analogies, the executive team\\'s exercise of warrants, and extensions of open-label periods are, at best, poor surrogates for the drug\\'s efficacy, and at worst, could be seen as an attempt to divert attention from more pressing concerns.\\xa0The sponsor has promised transparency and timeliness, and if they adhere to this commitment, we believe it will soon become evident that the drug is not what it was purported to be.\\n\\n**Cash Burn and Warrants**\\xa0\\n\\nThe ongoing phase 3 trials and legal proceedings are reflected in Cassava\\'s high operating expenses. General and Administrative (G&A) costs were $4.2M, $4M, $3.7M, and $46M over the last four quarters. The spike in Q2 2024 is primarily due to the inclusion of the potential $40M SEC settlement, but even when excluding this, the quarterly expenses stood at approximately $6M, representing a significant increase both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Research and Development (R&D) expenses were $23.6M, $18.7M, $16.2M, and $15.2M for the last four quarters. The company expects R&D costs to modestly decline as patient enrollment has been completed. As disclosed during the recent call, Cassava ended the last quarter with $207M in cash, which should provide enough runway to complete the ongoing trials in Alzheimer\\'s Disease. While the potential SEC settlement may significantly impact this figure, the CFO indicated that the company would still have sufficient funds to carry them well into 2025. This financial \"stability\" is largely attributed to the buy-one-get-one-free sale of warrants, where holders were entitled to\\xa0[receive an additional 0.5 shares of common stock](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001069530/000143774924005894/sava20231231_10k.htm)\\xa0for each warrant exercised. This move grossed approximately $126M, effectively issuing nearly 6 million shares, or 14% of the prior shares outstanding.\\n\\n**Risks**\\n\\nCassava\\'s stock has been shrouded in controversy for some time, and investors are well aware of the volatility inherent in clinical biotech, particularly with SAVA. Currently, the short interest in the stock is approximately 40%. While we believe the fundamentals have deteriorated and view the stock as a sell, there are several risks that could impact this investment thesis.\\n\\nFirst, the ongoing investigation might find no wrongdoing, leaving the early-stage data on Simufilam unchallenged. Such an outcome would likely reinforce market confidence in the drug\\'s mechanism of action and potential efficacy.\\n\\nSecond, the phase 3 trial could demonstrate the drug\\'s benefit, or the company might present the data in a way that suggests a \"benefit,\" potentially de-risking the product.\\n\\nLastly, the SEC investigation could result in a smaller-than-expected settlement, or no material settlement at all, thereby strengthening the sponsor\\'s cash position.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nCassava’s situation has evolved dramatically since our last coverage. As we previously highlighted, the legal and regulatory challenges facing Cassava demand caution—and the recent developments underscore this necessity.\\n\\nThe indictment of Dr. Wang, coupled with the abrupt \"resignation\" of both the CEO and SVP of Neuroscience, raises significant concerns about Simufilam\\'s viability as a clinical candidate and Cassava\\'s integrity as a company. With Simufilam as the sole product in late-stage development, any failure in efficacy would severely impact the stock. The new management’s reliance on baseball analogies, personal anecdotes, and warrant exercises does little to inspire confidence and, if anything, could be seen by some as red flags.\\n\\nRelying on historical comparisons and single-arm open-label trials is insufficient. These methodologies are vulnerable to bias and are unlikely to demonstrate true \"disease-modifying\" efficacy, instead revealing confounding factors. The already shaky hypothesis of Simufilam\\'s effectiveness in mild patients—who are more susceptible to placebo effects and symptomatic improvements—is even less credible in light of recent events.\\n\\nIf the company adheres to the transparency standards it has recently pledged, we anticipate that the upcoming topline data readouts will be disappointing. Given that Dr. Wang’s indictment was reported in late June, the case could move to court by the end of 2024 or early 2025. Investors should closely monitor this case, as a guilty plea could expedite proceedings and materially affect Cassava\\'s future.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nIn conclusion, we view Cassava as a sell.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\~ARCM\\n\\n\\n\\n**Disclaimer:** The content provided in this post is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice, investment recommendations, or an endorsement of any particular company or stock.

At todays gold prices that is worth zero trillion and change.  For this quantity of gold reserves to be valued at one trillion dollars (which would cover less than 3% of the 35 trillion dollar debt) gold would need to be at $3,800.  If you wanted to back the current debt with 10% of the gold reserves held by the US gold would need to be $13,000.  Point is gold is undervalued and I\\'ve seen gold vs M2 charts that show gold is cheaper today at 2400 than it was in the year 2000 when it was priced at 300.  \\n\\nI have no expectations that the US will return to a gold standard and I\\'m not arguing for that.  I am saying that the bond traders, gold traders and FX traders will bid gold higher and the dollar lower until the treasury departments gold reserves are valued at higher and higher percentages of the national debt.  \\n\\nCentral banks NEED gold.  And they are price insensitive because they have printing presses.  \\n\\nAfter another several quarters of earnings beats by the senior gold producers word on the street is going to get out and fund managers will be forced to start allocating capital towards the GDX and seniors and then we work our way down to silver and the juniors from there.  \\n\\nAs the seniors and mid tiers earn more and more free cash flow they will start to have the funding to go through a merger and acquisition cycle which is also bullish.  Yield curve steepening may challenge the stock market causing a flight to safety bid for gold and imminent Fed rate cuts will for sure be bad for the dollar index where counter algorithms will go after gold.   \\n\\nSo keep some powder dry if we have a tank job like we did recently and the GDX washes out again pick up some leaps on the GDX or your favorite senior.  I don\\'t know exactly what happened in the gold market recently but all the price action is very constructive and honestly impressive.  Eight all time high weekly closing prices in the past months and all the moving averages are rank stacked, ordered and rising at a 45 degree angle.   \\n\\nGold is a big exhaustive topic so I\\'ll stop here and remind everyone gold is a central banks tier one asset and the supply demand fundamentals favor ever higher gold prices and deep into the future could end in a tulip panic mania bubble.  There is no fever like gold fever when it finally infects the general public.  In the age of influencers god help J Powell if the metals ever start trending on places like wallstreetbets, ticktock et al.  But that is likely many years into the future.

While Samsung\\'s 12-layer version of HBM3E chips has not yet passed Nvidia\\'s tests, the progress made thus far is promising.\\n\\nNvidia declined to comment. In a statement to Reuters, Samsung mentioned that the testing of its products was proceeding as planned, adding that it was \"in the process of optimizing its products through collaboration with various customers,\" without providing further details.\\n\\nHBM is a type of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) standard first produced in 2013, where chips are vertically stacked to save space and reduce power consumption.

This is not financial advice, it's actually the easiest DD that I think I’ve ever seen and I keep waiting for someone else to see what I see and post about it (because I’m a lurker, not a poster. But above all I’m here for sweet tendies). I’ve invested in this company on and off since c. 2018 and recently have seen a big uptick in interest thanks to our GOAT friend AI. For whatever reason, even with this increased interest, I continue to add to my positions waiting and waiting for someone to make the connection… But in the words of the Great Bill O’Reilly “Fuck it, we’ll do it live!”\\n\\n\\xa0\\\\*\\\\*Key Point/ Secret Sauce First, Disclaimer, TLDR, additional comments/DD, sources at end\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n**Key Point/ Secret Sauce:**\\n\\nWe’re all (sorry NVDA bears) on the same page about AI. AI is here to stay, it’s a god send, and it prints money. AI also, though, absolutely sucks down energy. Like as much as small nations… \\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\nMore and more people are realizing the energy consumption issue AI faces. Whether that be Altman \\\\[2\\\\] (starting his own nuclear power company cough cough), Goldman Sachs \\\\[3\\\\], WEF \\\\[4\\\\], Yale \\\\[5\\\\]… etc. And more and more the answer is looking to be nuclear power.\\xa0\\n\\nSMRs are both the leading tech for nuclear power moving forward that much is clear (you’ll have to just do the research on that one yourself). And the leader in this leading tech is NuScale (guys they have the guh damn ticker $SMR even). With all eyes moving towards nuclear, $SMR has begun to slowly come more and more into favor.\\xa0\\n\\nIMO, though, $SMR should be the **~ONLY~** nuclear power play. To be fair this is entirely predicated, also, on $NVDA continuing to be the biggest player in tech/AI. Partially because of the dollar amounts involved with SMRs. NuScale previously was expecting a fully operational plant/campus to cost \\\\~$3b. This cost would later balloon to \\\\~$9b, of which the government would help with about 50%. At worst let’s say the first round cost $10b and no government funding. This has always been the largest hurdle to nuclear power plant development, upfront costs.\\n\\nIf an AI company like NVDA decided that they wanted to move from making chips exclusively, to designing/building/implementing entire AI infrastructure hubs (so called AI factories) \\\\[6\\\\] then perhaps they would be interested in upstream M&A of power suppliers for said factories. IF a company like NVDA wanted to do this, then they could in theory buy all of SMR (current market cap \\\\~$1.4b) and float the $10b for first campus development for a total of $11b invested! But at that scale, what’s $12b? We could easily see SMR get scooped up at a healthy premium from here. $MTTR, for example, recently acquired as an AI software play at +120% valuation in April.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge amount until you look at 1. The cash and equivalents that NVDA has ($31b at EOQ 04/30/24 and generating more FCF than they know what to do with or \\\\~$15b LAST QT), 2. The level of investments being made into the AI space already (often in the $10b+), and 3. The secret sauce kicker that no one has mentioned - Oregon (fucking) State University. Go Beavs!\\n\\nHOW HAS NO ONE ELSE PUT THIS TOGETHER!? NuScale is based in Corvallis, OR with OSU. The SMR was invented in 2007 at OSU by NuScale. JENSEN HUANG GRADUATED FROM OSU and has been active in the school and community more so than ever before. This man was on campus in April for AI Week! Jensen (and his wife) personally donated $50m towards the development of a new “Collaborative Innovation Complex.”\\n\\nLook I have no additional information here, only the publicly available fact that Jensen Huang went to, and continues to be involved with, Oregon State University. Jensen Huang (and the AI field at large) also has a major energy issue. NuScale has deep roots to OSU also, including almost 25 years of history (aka NuScale’s entire history). I have no secret knowledge or reason to believe that these two parties have met or talked at all. However, look at this picture of Jensen with all of the OSU big wigs, there for at least an entire day if not multiple days, and tell me that not once did someone mention NuScale to him… JENSEN HUANG MUST KNOW ABOUT NUSCALE AND MUST KNOW IT IS THE ANSWER TO HIS LOOMING PROBLEM.\\n\\n[ Jensen Huang at OSU \\\\[7\\\\]](https://preview.redd.it/o3qxj69h4wcd1.png?width=1047&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbf9b3ba801d18b57c3a219ca09afd05d03087de)\\n\\n**DISCLAIMER** - Positions - 1000 SMR shares, 40 x SMR Calls (12/19/25) K = $15 bought at various times, 100 x SMR Calls (11/15/24) K = 20, 125 x SMR Calls (08/02/24) K = $20 bought 07/15/24 (after that Friday bump even because I still love it at 16). Told all my family and friends the connection and that I planned on posting this a week ago so they could buy if they wanted (not sure if anyone did or did not). I do not know about your financial position, goals, timeline, etc so this is not advice or a recommendation. I don’t know shit about ass here, y’all.\\xa0\\n\\n**TLDR:** Jensen Huang was raised in Oregon, graduated from Oregon State University, has near infinite money, needs near infinite power for AI. SMR was raised in Oregon, from Oregon State University, needs near infinite money, has near infinite power for AI. SMR to at least $100,000,000,000,000/share (jk I personally have a PT of $22)\\n\\n**Bonus Comments/ DD:**\\n\\nIt’s important to also note that the primary issue with developing nuclear power plants since the 1970s has really been upfront costs. A new AP1000 (700MWe) cost, call it, $5b and a new SMR complex of 8-12 (616MWe - 924MWe) reactors would cost, call it, $10b. However, being NuScale’s first proof of concept means the costs are inflated on the front end for R&D/regulatory/etc. Plus NuScale has the added benefit of being able to produce a site with only 1-2 reactors which would (presumably) cost approx 1/10 the cost moving forward. According to Scientific America, by 2027 NVIDIA’s 1.5m shipped chips would be consuming 85.4 TWe (THAT’S 85,400,000 MWe). \\\\[8\\\\]\\n\\nSecond, it is worth noting the massive overlap in cutting edge AI providers and sustainability. The leading companies like Meta ($7.4b) \\\\[9\\\\], Google ($16b) \\\\[10\\\\], Amazon ($12.6b) \\\\[11\\\\], Apple ($4.7b) \\\\[12\\\\], Microsoft ($10b+) \\\\[13\\\\] all have stated greenhouse gas/energy goals. Many of these companies have specifically commented on these goals and their relation to the AI rollout. The listed dollar amounts are over various timeframes but are all massive regardless and dollars already allocated towards this goal. Microsoft (printing AI money second only to $NVDA) has a stated goal of being carbon NEGATIVE by the end of the decade. \\\\[14\\\\] Seriously, what’s 10 or even 20 billion to one of these companies at this point?\\n\\nThird, something everyone somehow also missed was the ADVANCE Act passing. According to the US Office Of Nuclear Energy, the goals specifically include Microreactors, HALEU (being tested to further enhance SMRs),investing in america, and the aim to “accelerate new reactor deployments in the United States!” This bill shows that the feds also see not only the looming power crisis from AI but the potential for SMR technology specifically. \\\\[15\\\\] Pst there’s only one company that currently has SMR designs approved by the DOE. \\\\[16\\\\] They literally just need someone to float the funding to start off the dawn of the new nuclear age.\\n\\nFourth, and this one is just harder speculation… when interest rates drop (futures market pricing that in September now) there could (should?) be a wave of M&A that comes with it. And if not M&A, then it at least becomes more likely that someone would be willing to finance an operation like this!\\n\\nFifth and final, $SMR has a decent short interest at \\\\~19% according to FinViz \\\\[17\\\\]. There are \\\\~150 other companies between $300m - $2b market cap and SI over 15% so pretty high but not like that one stock in 2020…\\xa0\\n\\nOfficially, by the way, NuScale is “headquartered” in Portland, Oregon… But, that is mostly admin staff. Research, design, and engineering are largely done in Corvallis because OSU has a world class nuclear engineering program. \\\\[18\\\\]\\n\\nSources:\\n\\n1.

The Biden administration wants to stem the flow of the world’s most powerful chips to China, fearing Beijing may use them to create more powerful AI systems with military applications._\\n\\n_The resulting shortage of AI chips has hit the ability of Chinese tech groups such as ByteDance, Tencent and Alibaba to compete with US-based OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta and Google in a technology that is reshaping the industry._\\n\\n_Each H20 chip costs between $12,000 and $13,000, suggesting that Nvidia is likely to generate upwards of $12bn in sales. That would be more than the $10.3bn revenue made from its entire China business — including selling graphics chips to PC gamers and other products — in the financial year ending in January 2024._\\n\\n_Nvidia declined to comment on the forecasts. Huawei did not respond to a request for comment.\\nEver since the Biden administration first introduced restrictions on Nvidia’s ability to sell its most powerful AI chips in China in 2022, the US company has warned that its business would suffer as cloud computing providers and AI start-ups there turned to local alternatives such as Huawei._\\n\\n_“Our business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, said during the company’s most recent earnings call in May. “And it’s a lot more competitive in China now, because of the limitations on our technology\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009However, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there.”\\nColette Kress, Nvidia’s finance chief, said on the same call that revenue from its data centre segment — which includes AI chips — in China in the latest quarter was “down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October”._\\n\\n_As recently as 2021, before the US began imposing export controls, China accounted for more than a quarter of Nvidia’s total revenues. Even if the H20 chip sells as well as analysts expect, China could be closer to 10 per cent of sales this year. But that also reflects the huge growth that Nvidia is seeing from US tech companies as they build out ever-larger AI systems._\\n\\n_Although Nvidia’s sales in China have been lower ahead of the rollout of the new H20 this spring, analysts at both Morgan Stanley and SemiAnalysis say that the chip is now being shipped in volume and is proving popular with Chinese customers, despite its downgraded performance compared with the chips Nvidia can sell in the US._\\n\\n_“Buyers report positive feedback on the potential competitiveness of H20 clusters,” Morgan Stanley wrote in a research note to clients this week, pointing to “strong China demand”._\\n\\nPositions: leaps.

In April 2024, Musk told investors that Tesla would deliver \"new vehicles, including more-affordable models\" by early 2025, earlier than the previously communicated timeline for a low-cost \"Model 2\" originally expected in late 2025\\\\[2\\\\]\\\\[16\\\\].\\n2. However, these new affordable models seem to be different from the highly anticipated $25,000 \"Model 2\" that Tesla had been promising for years. Reuters reported in April 2024 that Tesla had abandoned plans for the Model 2\\\\[2\\\\]\\\\[16\\\\].\\n3. When Reuters first reported the cancellation of the Model 2, Musk denied it on social media, calling the publication \"liars\"\\\\[1\\\\]. But Tesla\\'s Q1 2024 financial results confirmed a change of plans - the new affordable vehicles would use existing platforms rather than the \"next-generation vehicle platform\" expected to enable cheaper production via an \"unboxed\" manufacturing process\\\\[1\\\\]\\\\[2\\\\].\\n4. Tesla stated this change may result in less cost reduction than previously expected for the affordable models, suggesting they may cost more than the Model 2\\'s anticipated $25,000 price\\\\[2\\\\]. Musk declined to provide specifics about the new vehicles\\\\[2\\\\].\\n5. Some analysts interpreted Tesla\\'s comments as confirmation that the dedicated Model 2 platform had indeed been shelved, contrary to Musk\\'s earlier denial\\\\[2\\\\]. The company is focusing resources on the Robotaxi project instead\\\\[5\\\\].\\n6. The inconsistent messaging came as Tesla faced slowing sales growth and increasing competition, especially from Chinese rivals like BYD\\\\[2\\\\]\\\\[10\\\\]. The Model 3 and Y, Tesla\\'s current cheapest offerings, are aging compared to competitors\\\\[6\\\\]\\\\[9\\\\]\\\\[12\\\\].\\n\\nWhile Musk has continued to promise more affordable Teslas, the specific $25,000 Model 2 that generated much anticipation appears to have been canceled in favor of repurposed existing designs, despite his initial denial. The timing of the revised plans and Musk\\'s shifting statements suggest an effort to reassure investors and counter negative press impacting Tesla\\'s stock price. However, the lack of clarity around the capability and pricing of the upcoming vehicles relative to the original Model 2 concept raises questions about whether Tesla is actually on track to deliver the \"next-gen\" affordable EV platform it has long touted.\\n\\nCitations:\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] [https://electrek.co/2024/04/23/tesla-announces-change-of-plans-to-build-cheaper-electric-cars/](https://electrek.co/2024/04/23/tesla-announces-change-of-plans-to-build-cheaper-electric-cars/)\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] [https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-promises-more-affordable-vehicles-cybercab/](https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-promises-more-affordable-vehicles-cybercab/)\\n\\n\\\\[3\\\\] [https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-quarterly-revenue-falls-first-time-since-2020-2024-04-23/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-quarterly-revenue-falls-first-time-since-2020-2024-04-23/)\\n\\n\\\\[4\\\\] [https://www.autoblog.com/2023/11/17/a-top-tesla-investor-said-he-plans-to-ditch-his-model-y-for-a-rivian-after-elon-musk-agreed-with-antisemitic-post/](https://www.autoblog.com/2023/11/17/a-top-tesla-investor-said-he-plans-to-ditch-his-model-y-for-a-rivian-after-elon-musk-agreed-with-antisemitic-post/)\\n\\n\\\\[5\\\\] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilyRkL9m-1k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilyRkL9m-1k)\\n\\n\\\\[6\\\\] [https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/1897dwc/cybertruck\\\\_aside\\\\_tesla\\\\_hasnt\\\\_released\\\\_a\\\\_new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/1897dwc/cybertruck_aside_tesla_hasnt_released_a_new/)\\n\\n\\\\[7\\\\] [https://time.com/6336614/tesla-and-x-face-advertiser-and-investor-fallout-over-elon-musks-controversial-post/](https://time.com/6336614/tesla-and-x-face-advertiser-and-investor-fallout-over-elon-musks-controversial-post/)\\n\\n\\\\[8\\\\] [https://www.thestreet.com/technology/history-of-tesla-15088992](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/history-of-tesla-15088992)\\n\\n\\\\[9\\\\] [https://www.fastcompany.com/90945689/teslas-cybertruck-has-a-serious-problem-that-only-a-complete-redesign-can-fix](https://www.fastcompany.com/90945689/teslas-cybertruck-has-a-serious-problem-that-only-a-complete-redesign-can-fix)\\n\\n\\\\[10\\\\] [https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-responds-tesla-byd-comparison/](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-responds-tesla-byd-comparison/)\\n\\n\\\\[11\\\\] [https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-reneges-on-order-agreement-car-price.218710/](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-reneges-on-order-agreement-car-price.218710/)\\n\\n\\\\[12\\\\] [https://autos.yahoo.com/ancient-tesla-model-y-won-141500415.html](https://autos.yahoo.com/ancient-tesla-model-y-won-141500415.html)\\n\\n\\\\[13\\\\] [https://www.eenews.net/articles/tesla-layoffs-shake-confidence-in-the-ev-charging-future/](https://www.eenews.net/articles/tesla-layoffs-shake-confidence-in-the-ev-charging-future/)\\n\\n\\\\[14\\\\] [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule)\\n\\n\\\\[15\\\\] [https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you](https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you)\\n\\n\\\\[16\\\\] [https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-electric-musk-has-promised-new-low-cost-evs-but-tesla-has-none](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-electric-musk-has-promised-new-low-cost-evs-but-tesla-has-none)\\n\\n# Part 4:\\n\\nIt appears that Tesla and Elon Musk may be facing several potential violations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) and other securities regulations:\\n\\n1. Inaccurate financial reporting: The whistleblower complaint filed with the SEC in 2021 alleged that Tesla had been miscategorizing repairs and hiding warranty costs for years, potentially misstating fundamental financial information\\\\[3\\\\]. If proven true, this could violate SOX requirements for accurate financial reporting and adequate internal controls (see part 5, this is still alive).\\n\\n2. Inadequate internal controls: The same whistleblower complaint raised concerns about Tesla\\'s inconsistent communications and policies, which allegedly contributed to employees miscategorizing repair costs\\\\[3\\\\]. SOX requires companies to maintain effective internal control systems to ensure accurate financial reporting\\\\[7\\\\].\\n\\n3. Misleading statements about self-driving capabilities: Tesla faces legal and regulatory scrutiny over potentially false or misleading claims about its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) systems\\\\[1\\\\]. If Musk or other executives made materially false statements about the safety or capabilities of these systems, it could violate SOX provisions against knowingly submitting inaccurate information.\\n\\n4. Diversion of resources to other Musk ventures: Lawsuits allege that Musk breached his fiduciary duties to Tesla by diverting employees and resources to his other companies, like Twitter (now X)\\\\[1\\\\]. While not directly a SOX violation, this could indicate a lack of proper corporate governance and oversight.\\n\\n5. Insider trading allegations: Musk is facing multiple shareholder lawsuits accusing him of insider trading by selling large amounts of Tesla stock while aware of non-public information about the company\\'s challenges\\\\[1\\\\]. Insider trading is a serious violation of securities laws.\\n\\n6. Delayed distribution of settlement funds: Tesla has accused the SEC of violating its own rules by failing to distribute $40 million in settlement funds to shareholders in a timely manner\\\\[5\\\\]. While not a direct SOX violation by Tesla, it highlights the complex regulatory environment the company operates in.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn contrast to these potential violations, SOX and other securities regulations generally require public companies to provide accurate, reliable financial reporting, maintain effective internal controls, and avoid misleading statements or omissions. The \"hype\" and controversy surrounding Tesla and Musk, including the allegations outlined above, suggest that the company may not be fully complying with these requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that many of these allegations are still being litigated or investigated, and have not been definitively proven. Tesla\\'s stock price performance and Musk\\'s continued promotion of the company\\'s prospects indicate that many investors may still believe in the company\\'s long-term potential, despite these regulatory challenges and governance concerns.\\n\\n\\n\\nCitations:\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] [https://www.flyingpenguin.com/?p=45717](https://www.flyingpenguin.com/?p=45717)\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] [https://ir.tesla.com/\\\\_flysystem/s3/sec/000156459022016871/tsla-10ka\\\\_20211231-gen.pdf](https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000156459022016871/tsla-10ka_20211231-gen.pdf)\\n\\n\\\\[3\\\\] [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html)\\n\\n\\\\[4\\\\] [https://ir.tesla.com/\\\\_flysystem/s3/sec/000095017023001409/tsla-20221231-gen.pdf](https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000095017023001409/tsla-20221231-gen.pdf)\\n\\n\\\\[5\\\\] [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-sec-is-violating-its-own-rules-by-holding-up-40-m-shareholder-payout-194905601.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-sec-is-violating-its-own-rules-by-holding-up-40-m-shareholder-payout-194905601.html)\\n\\n\\\\[6\\\\] [https://ir.tesla.com/\\\\_flysystem/s3/sec/000162828024002390/tsla-20231231-gen.pdf](https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000162828024002390/tsla-20231231-gen.pdf)\\n\\n\\\\[7\\\\] [https://business-law-review.law.miami.edu/teslas-governance-challenges-navigating-the-complex-intersection-of-relationships-and-fiduciary-duties/](https://business-law-review.law.miami.edu/teslas-governance-challenges-navigating-the-complex-intersection-of-relationships-and-fiduciary-duties/)\\n\\n\\\\[8\\\\] [https://ir.tesla.com/\\\\_flysystem/s3/sec/000156459021004599/tsla-10k\\\\_20201231-gen.pdf](https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231-gen.pdf)\\n\\n\\n\\n# Part 5: The Escapist\\n\\nIt appears that the 2021 whistleblower complaint filed with the SEC against Tesla regarding its accounting practices for warranty repairs has not been fully resolved.\\n\\n1. In 2021, Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint with the SEC alleging that the company had been miscategorizing warranty repairs as \"goodwill\" since at least 2017, potentially allowing Tesla to avoid properly recording warranty expenses and inflate its earnings.\\n2. The whistleblowers claimed that if Tesla had accurately categorized these repairs as warranty work, it would likely need to restate earnings for every quarter since at least 2017.\\n3. However, according to a CNBC report in October 2023, the SEC looked at only one portion of the complaint and then closed the investigation without interviewing the whistleblowers or evaluating the 18,000 files of documentation they provided.\\n4. One of the whistleblowers, Lukasz Krupski, then leaked the so-called \"Tesla Files\" to the media in late 2023, leading to court injunctions and warnings from Tesla.\\xa0Krupski received a whistleblowing prize in 2023 for his efforts.\\n5. The leaked data also implicated Tesla in serious data protection lapses, with sensitive employee information being readily accessible on internal systems.\\xa0Dutch authorities are investigating whether this violated privacy laws as of November 2023.\\n6. As of October 2023, there is no indication that the SEC has reopened its investigation or taken any enforcement action against Tesla based on the whistleblowers\\' accounting fraud allegations.\\n\\nWhile the 2021 whistleblower complaint raised serious concerns about Tesla\\'s accounting practices and treatment of warranty costs, the SEC\\'s initial investigation appears to have been brief and limited in scope. The subsequent leak of internal Tesla data in 2023 brought renewed attention to the allegations, but there is no clear resolution of the accounting fraud claims as of the latest information in the provided search results. The whistleblowers\\' concerns about Tesla\\'s financial reporting remain largely unaddressed by regulators.'}, {'text': '# Sources:\\n\\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/Releases/g19/current/](https://www.federalreserve.gov/Releases/g19/current/)\\n\\n[https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/HHDC\\\\_2024Q1.pdf?sc\\\\_lang=en](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/HHDC_2024Q1.pdf?sc_lang=en)\\n\\n# What is consumer credit and why should I care?\\n\\nDifferent people use different metrics to determine whether the economy and/or the market is doing well. People use jobs numbers, inflation, the misery index, GDP growth, gas prices, shipping volume, etc. I use consumer credit, specifically the G.19 Consumer Credit Outstanding survey done monthly by the Federal Reserve. The reason is that the entire American economy sans public spending (which is laid out by congressional budgets ahead of time and already factored into total market valuations) eventually trickles down to what the average Joe goes out and buys. Yes, even AI and all the hype around that eventually comes down to \"how can we use this to sell people stuff\".\\n\\nConsumer spending drives market growth. Consumers spend beyond their means on a regular basis through the use of credit. This credit can be revolving, like credit cards, or nonrevolving, like home equity lines of credit (HELOC) or auto loans. The pulse of the consumer\\'s financial health is the rate of growth of their revolving credit balance. A typical yearly cycle will see rising and falling credit balances with an average annual growth rate of about 5%. However, since 2020 this cycle has been anything but typical.\\n\\nIn 2020, credit card balances dropped through the floor as Americans made the prudent decision to pay off their credit cards with the money from the government stimulus checks. This was followed by 2021 seeing a rapid increase in credit card spending, which economists were not concerned about as this was a \"correction\" back to previous debt and spending levels. The issue was that inflation was now beginning to outpace the rising wages people experienced during the pandemic, and in 2022 we saw an eye-watering 15% increase in revolving credit balances year over year. Keep in mind, the average yearly increase is 3-6%. This was primarily driven by inflation, as people were being forced to use credit cards to pay bills or for necessities. In 2023 we saw another 8.8% growth in revolving debt year over year, meaning this was on top of the previous 15% growth in debt from the previous year. This is likely due to the sticky inflation around core expenses like food, cars, housing, etc.\\n\\nThis trend did not appear to be slowing down in Q1 2024 either. In January we saw a 7.5% YoY increase, and February another double-digit 10.7% increase. However, in March, growth of revolving debt is only 1.5%, and for April, the most recent number, revolving debt has actually gone down by -0.4%. What\\'s going on? Did people suddenly stop charging on their credit cards? At first I thought this could be due to people using their tax returns to pay off their debts, but this data is seasonally adjusted, meaning the only way that could be the case is if people did not pay their credit card balances off with last year\\'s tax return but this year they are. That would also imply that people are more financially sound this year than they were in 2023. Personally, I do not believe that is true, and I believe the motor vehicle loans prove this.\\n\\n# What do cars have to do with credit cards?\\n\\nMotor vehicle loans reflect an American\\'s largest consumer good. Growth in these loans for the past 3 years has been enormous as supply shocks, high interest rates, and lots of consumer demand drove prices of new and used cars up. But if we look at outstanding motor vehicle loans for Q1 2024 we see they\\'ve actually gone down compared to Q4 of 2023. What happened? Why would people stop buying cars in Q1, the time of year when people get a big down payment in the form of a tax return? Could people just be paying off their auto loans too?\\n\\nOne thing you have to understand about the mentality of the American consumer is they do not know how to not spend money. The Becky Index illustrates this better than probably anything else. To quote a bible, \"No amount of economic or political turmoil will keep women from their fake eyelashes.\" In 2020, people paid off debt with a windfall from the government because they had nothing to spend it on, they were locked inside their homes. Now, we have vacations to go on, cars to buy, expensive toys to flex, we as a consumer demographic will spend money compulsively, because at the bottom of our terrified souls the thing we fear most is for others to think we are struggling, or worse, poor.\\n\\n# If consumers always spend money, why did they stop spending money?\\n\\nThey didn\\'t.\\n\\nWhen a delinquent loan becomes uncollectable, it is passed to a collections agency. The bank that held the loan then considers it a \"charge-off\" which is no longer a collectable debt, and thus it is removed from the numbers visible in the G.19 statistic. It is my hypothesis that consumers are still spending money on their credit cards and are still buying cars, but we have reached an inflection point where any increase in consumer debt through spending is countered by unpaid debts going to collections somewhere else. Consumers will spend money until they can\\'t and what\\'s happening is they literally can\\'t. They have run out of credit and we are beginning to see the collections outpace new spending on the credit card and motor vehicle loans. Loan forgiveness and/or write-offs are inherently deflationary as they remove money from circulation via a contraction of the money multiplier.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yi0toxne9p5d1.png?width=1789&format=png&auto=webp&s=be55701812a208c9e3905c0d0ba9b7e737b86c7e\\n\\nWith the exception of Gen Z, credit card delinquency hasn\\'t been this high since the great recession. You may also notice that this balance percentage lines up pretty well with the numbers for January and February revolving debt growth. Other interesting graphs are Transition into Serious Delinquency (90+) for Auto Loans by Age, and Auto Loan Originations by Age. All these signs, in my opinion, point to a tapped out American consumer, and without more consumer spending, growth is off the table.\\n\\n# What\\'s going to happen?\\n\\nNo idea. People love to say that nothing will happen before the election, but we went from 9.8% revolving consumer credit growth to nothing in 1 month. Bear markets tend to happen fast and they tend to happen after a particularly bullish run, especially a bullish run that isn\\'t based on any fundamentals and is highly speculative. I have no solid idea how bad a recession or market crash this is gonna be, or even if it will happen, I mean hell we\\'ve kicked the can this long. However, if I gaze into my crystal ball, this is what I see:  \\nQ2 earnings from consumer driven companies will likely be a little tepid. Not catastrophic, remember, people are still spending money, but down-ish. However, earnings reports are mostly about the outlook for the next quarter and remainder of the year. I would expect these companies to begin moving their expected earnings down for Q3 and end of year. Assuming the election theory holds true, the market will probably continue its bull run into November, after which I would expect all hell to break loose in Q1. However, I\\'m about 60/40 on before or after the election, and my 60% is on the September Bear coming out of its cave particularly hungry. There might be a slight pop around election time as the speculation cools down, but it will be a dead cat bounce. Unfortunately, I\\'m an amateur economist and not a financial expert, so I don\\'t know the best instruments to capitalize on this information, however I am leaning towards volatility plays moreso than puts, since the market tends to go apeshit before it crashes.\\n\\n# TL;DR\\n\\nConsumers are defaulting on debt as fast as they\\'re spending and it\\'s stalling out growth.

Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you\\'re the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen [here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYm3BaIonv0&ab_channel=AT%26T). \\n\\nTheir initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations.

This isn\\'t just SoS text messaging. This is full broadband connectivity from space, no extra chips, antennas, or satellite dishes needed.

Some kid in Somalia now has access to an education which leads to them discovering the cure for cancer. Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world.\\n\\nThere are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let\\'s say they\\'re the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let\\'s say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let\\'s go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That\\'s $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That\\'s considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nTypical wsb responses\\n\\n#####\"But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS\"\\n\\n-_____- ...\\n\\n#####\"But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time\"\\n\\nASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn\\'t even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. [Around 1:12:00 for the cream.](https://www.fcc.gov/march-2024-open-commission-meeting)\\n\\n#####\"So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up\"\\n\\nEven if they did, they don\\'t have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over.\\n\\n#####\"SpaceX can just buy them out\"\\n\\nAbel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn\\'t. He\\'s not looking to sell, he\\'s looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn\\'t cut it. To date, there hasn\\'t been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share.\\n\\n#####\"But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run\"\\n\\nThe initial spike doesn\\'t really count for anything, that\\'s just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we\\'re rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue.\\n\\n#####\"But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX\"\\n\\nThe Starlink offering was touted as [17mbps, with a 15% packet loss](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1764032892663906313?lang=en), and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it\\'s final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet [here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago](https://x.com/spacex/status/1792981845296160791?s=46&t=vg6hLz-68IK28GznXUCu2g) - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed \"17mbps\" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area. To his credit, Elon does somewhat set expectations, but the praise expressed in the X responses makes it clear that his followers only consume the headline.

This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% \"long term\". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I\\'m inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That\\'s just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion)\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Latest speculation:**\\n\\nEarlier this month, [AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/att-ast-spacemobile-tie-up-provide-space-based-broadband-network-2024-05-15/). Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, [Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240604977331/en/AST-SpaceMobile-Welcomes-Telecom-Industry-Veteran-Johan-Wibergh-to-Board-of-Directors). Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it\\'s way to the front of the [Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website](https://ast-science.com/company/strategic-partners/) where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? [More discussion around this speculation can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/1d742ey/strategic_partners_webpage_updated_theory/).\\n\\nBut you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---\\'s [recent post on WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1d3m8ew/posted_this_here_5_days_ago_got_6_likes_up_116/), each of which will give the SP a nice bump \\n\\nI\\'ve been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn\\'t recommend option plays...

About a month until earnings.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------  \\n**5/15 Market Update -**\\n\\nThis is probably my last update, but just to be clear, I am still in this trade and have not sold a single contract. I know the market has been ripping. I know that almost every morning, $RL will explode for a 1-2 point gain. Noticably, however, is that it always starts to sell off mid-day and then will settle within the 165-168 range. Despite the rest of the market just completely green, this gives me a TON of confidence.\\n\\nThere just aren\\'t any real buyers for this stock right now (there\\'s no reason to have any buyers). There\\'s no real bullish analysis on this stock. There\\'s no tailwind for this sector. The only reason it has yet to sell off is because there\\'s no negative catalyst and all the institutional holders (which I see on yahoo is at 101% institutional ownership) generally just hold until there is news or earnings that gives them impetus to sell. \\n\\nAt the moment, the thesis is this:\\n\\n1. The stock is OVERVALUED based on 2024 year-end data and partial January sales. Those quarters were astronomically good for RL, but consumer spending has slowed dramatically since the last RL earnings call. The expectations for strong earnings is fatally flawwed. \\n\\n2. Guidance will also be revised downwards strongly. LULU and PVH (strongest beta values to RL) continue to trade sideways. Both gave terrible guidance. Despite the stock market roaring, those both are still basically trading sideways. \\n\\n3. Therefore, we\\'re looking for a revenue miss, an earnings miss, and a guidance revision downwards.\\n\\n4. Lauren Family sold 3 million (MILLION) shares. It also represented an exit filing. They dumped at \\\\~$180.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, as a point of reference that also gives me confidence, \\n\\n$LULU shed 20% within 2 days of their bad earnings report. They lost 30% within 3 weeks.\\n\\n$PVH shed 25% within 2 days of their bad earnings report.\\n\\n**Let\\'s say $RL breaks the sideways trend because the market just pulls it up and gets up to $170 the day before earnings.**\\n\\n**a 20% drop is $136, which puts us in the money (probably double our money).**\\n\\n**a 25% drop is $127.5, which puts us in the money (5-7 bagger)**\\n\\n**a 30% drop is $119 (my original price target), which puts us in the money (8-10 bagger).**\\n\\n**All three scenarios, if you look at our reference points, are within the realm of possibility. Especially if some crazy macro shit actually starts happening as well.** \\n\\nAnd that\\'s if RL gets up to $170. What if it starts to decline, beforehand?\\n\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\n4/26 Market Close Update\\n\\nSo obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.\\n\\nAs part of my update, I’m going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.\\n\\nFundamentals:\\n\\nThe major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I\\'ll continue to dissect why it\\'s still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.\\n\\n-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.\\n\\n-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year\\'s quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That\\'s fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html)\\n\\n-It\\'s increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following:\\n\\n(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That\\'s an expense that will hurt projected EPS.\\n\\n[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)\\n\\n(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter.\\n\\n(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That\\'s 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown.\\n\\n(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we\\'ve seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)\\n\\n(5) \"For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024.\" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It\\'s impossible.\\n\\n(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That\\'s uhhh, 100% of the LLC\\'s shares as \"long-term strategy for estate planning\". Also, it\\'s about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.\\n\\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rl/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rl/insider-activity)\\n\\n[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/144/0001968582-24-000171](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/144/0001968582-24-000171)\\n\\n[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html)\\n\\nThis is a remark in the last report\\n\\nRemarks:\\n\\nFollowing the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.\\n\\nHeadwinds:\\n\\n-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post \"We are so fucking back\" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.\\n\\n-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.\\n\\n-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.\\n\\nTailwinds:\\n\\n-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you\\'d like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call.\\n\\n-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed.\\n\\n-GDP isn\\'t as high as expectations. This isn\\'t necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it\\'s ultra bad and leads to stagflation.\\n\\nCatalysts:\\n\\nUnfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.\\n\\nNOTE ON PRICE ACTION:\\n\\nSince I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let\\'s say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they\\'re in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you\\'ll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You\\'ll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.\\n\\nStay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They\\'re still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that\\'s when you\\'ll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.\\n\\nThat\\'s it for now ---\\n\\n—-\\n\\n4/19 Market Close Update -So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn’t do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.\\n\\nWe see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike.\\n\\nWe also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech.\\n\\nThis of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).\\n\\n-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don’t be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it’s pretty low volume. Today included.\\n\\n-Speaking of SMCI’s lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that’s when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there’s a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT’S the major catalyst we’re aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets.\\n\\n-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing \\\\~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it’s wrong. But of course, market doesn’t dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It’s the analysts’ job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air.\\n\\nOther catalysts to look towards could be: -god forbid, further war escalation -a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It’s a non-zero chance. -Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel.\\n\\n4/19 That’s it for now.\\n\\n—- Original Post:\\n\\nI\\'m here to announce that I\\'ve closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\\\\_lauren\\\\_rl\\\\_is\\\\_a\\\\_10\\\\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)\\n\\nI had purchased in total \\\\~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.\\n\\nWhen I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \\\\~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \\\\~$188 to \\\\~$159.\\n\\nAll-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.\\n\\nAnd then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.\\n\\nMy DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:\\n\\n# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot\\n\\nWage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We\\'ve seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.\\n\\n# 2. Consumer debt has exploded\\n\\nHoliday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we\\'re starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.\\n\\n# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled\\n\\nYou might think \"but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!\" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)\\n\\nIt\\'s indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can\\'t afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.\\n\\nThis is consistent with **Nordstrom\\'s** latest earnings/guidance;\\n\\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)\\n\\n**Macy\\'s**\\n\\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)\\n\\nPlus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.\\n\\n# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)\\n\\nThis is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I\\'m going to circle back to the bolded point later).\\n\\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)\\n\\nAlso included within the article is this statement\\n\\n*\"Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*\\xa0[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)\\xa0*and Ralph Lauren*\\xa0[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)\\xa0*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH\\'s wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.\"*\\n\\nWhich is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).\\n\\nIt\\'s down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).\\n\\n# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.\\n\\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)\\n\\n# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically.\\n\\nDespite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched.

There\\'s a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.\\n\\n[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)\\n\\nFurther, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That\\'s slowing as well.\\n\\n8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff\\n\\nThe stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.\\n\\n**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data.\\n\\nThe guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.\\n\\nRL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \\\\~$192.\\n\\nThe current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.\\n\\nFinally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \\\\~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.\\n\\nI suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There\\'s just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.\\n\\nWithin the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).\\n\\nThere\\'s also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.\\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nRL will gap down, get puts.\\n\\nPRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.\\n\\nPOSITIONS: \\\\~$60k in June 21 2024 140Ps'}, {'text': 'Hello everyone,\\n\\nI do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)\\n* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)\\n* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive\\n* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport\\n* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley\\'s Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [\"Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia\"](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk\\'s own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.\\n* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**\\n\\nIn this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market.

Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late\\n\\nSecondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?\\n\\nThirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. \\n\\nFourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. \\n\\nIn conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !\\n\\n**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**\\n\\nDespite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:\\n\\n* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)\\n* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)\\n* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)\\n\\nThis is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.\\n\\nAccording to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2\\n\\nProbably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.\\n\\n**CONCLUSIONS**\\n\\nI would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA.

These cases will force him to loan or sell shares of $DJT, which would likely sink the share price.\\n\\n- The price is current at $60.00?! Everyone will definitely sell and I’m going to make a killing on the downfall.\\n\\nBull:\\n\\n- This is Donald Trump’s company? He wants to restore free speech? I want to be a part of this, so I’m gonna buy shares.\\n\\n- Donald Trump’s company just went public? This guy is the world’s #1 self-promotor & people are going to go crazy for this. I’m in.\\n\\n- The price is currently at $60.00?! I can get in early and in 10 years this thing will go 10x\\n\\nLike everything that relates to Donald Trump. $DJT is polarizing subject. Some would relish in seeing this thing completely and utterly fail, while others hope to see this truly succeed.\\n\\nSo why does this matter? If you happen to be in the I don’t GAF camp, I’m just here to make money. Then here’s why it matters, the politics of this stock has created a massive short squeeze opportunity the likes we haven’t seen since the stock who shall not be named (... \"we like the stock\").\\n\\nLet’s take a look, starting with the most recent ORTEX data:\\n\\n[SI Overview](https://preview.redd.it/k1hn3qhqqvrc1.png?width=3584&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c7dbf15c7638766bc500d7d8f049bc133ac4a0d)\\n\\n1. the Short interest value is $278.73 million.\\n2. the Cost to Borrow is at 342.71%.\\n\\nFor those who don’t follow this kind of thing, most stocks, especially those that are widely held and traded have a relatively low cost to borrow rate, often below 5%. Stocks that are in high demand for shorting, have limited availability, or are perceived as having higher risk may have significantly higher borrowing costs. Rates above 20% are generally considered high and indicate a particular set of circumstances that makes shorting those stocks more expensive. 290.65% annual borrowing cost is far outside the norm, It suggests an exceptionally high demand to short the stock, combined with a very limited supply of shares to borrow. Here’s where things get interesting…\\n\\nLet’s take a look at how much shorts are spending daily with these numbers:\\n\\n(SI \\\\* CTB) / days per year = cost per day.\\n\\n**($278,730,000 \\\\* 342.71%) / 365 = $2,617,083 per day the shorts are paying to borrow shares & short $DJT!**\\n\\nHow did shorts do lasts week with these high rates and high demand for $DJT?\\n\\n*Processing img 7rj9qlkubwrc1...*\\n\\nThey took a $95 million loss, lol!\\n\\nSo what are shorts doing now? Are they running for the hills? Are they declaring defeat?\\n\\n*Processing img anagfj98cwrc1...*\\n\\n\\nNope… They’re doubling down. Last Thursday they borrowed over 879k shares at a borrow rate of \\\\~ 600+%!!!\\n\\nWhich brings up the question. What are the shorts betting on?\\n\\nIt’s simple, the shorts are betting that they can get shareholders to sell based off the fundamentals of $DJT. Is this company making money? Is it worth the current valuation? The answer is no and no one would hold after acquiring these gains, right?\\n\\nWhat they aren’t realizing here is Trump supporters are holding $DJT. The same people who after 2 impeachments, 4 indictments, Jan 6th, “Grab em’ by the p\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*”, $DWAC SEC investigations, <insert random scandal here>, aren’t leaving his side. They are still buying his $400 shoes [for over $450,000](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-sneakers-ebay-profits-1872111), buying 110,000 of his [$100 “Trump baseball cards”](https://opensea.io/collection/trump-digital-trading-cards), and more than anything, still voting for him. These people would march through the gates of hell for Trump and would die before selling their shares. The shorts are GROSSLY underestimating to what lengths these people will go for Donald Trump.\\n\\nThis brings us to the crux of the situation. The shorts need to keep the price down and are throwing the kitchen sink at it. If they can’t, they will be forced to cover 4.5 million shares worth at whatever price the holders deem their shares are worth. All this while it’s costing the shorts $2,617,083 dollars per day to keep this going & it costs $DJT holders nothing. It’s quite clear which side can outlast the other in this situation.\\n\\nThat’s all I have to share for now. I hold $DJT shares and options. Obviously the squeeze would become more likely if investors buy shares in addition to options. Feel free to double check and correct any of my info. Good luck to everyone no matter what side you fall on. Hopefully we all can make some money on this.\\n\\n'}, {'text': 'Before this adderall-fueled hype train leaves the station next week, I thought i\\'d write up a definitive DD on the imminent DWAC/DJT merger.\\n\\nThis DD will cover everything: fundamentals, Truth Social, ownership, dilution, Trump\\'s holdings and lockup, the future of TMTG, regarded theories and more. You may have seen my [original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bkvr48/comment/kw10fel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (that was stolen and reposted) with a regarded theory about Trump selling shares - **if you can\\'t be bothered to read the full DD, then skip to the end for an updated regard theory of Trump potentially selling shares - now with new information and speculation!**\\n\\nBefore I begin, a quick shoutout to the legend that is u/SPAC_Time. This guy is probably the most knowledgeable person about SPACs i\\'ve ever seen, and has been posting excellent information over on r/DWAC_Uncensored, a lot of which is included in this DD. I strongly recommend going and having a look at this sub as it has SO much great information on it. There\\'s loads on there that i\\'ve not included in this DD. He\\'s also patiently answered all my questions, so thank you king.\\n\\nI\\'ve been following this since the beginning, and even made an account on Truth Social to see what the bulls are thinking. Honestly some of the shit they come out with over there make the regards on this sub seem like fucking Albert Einstein.\\n\\nI\\'ll also preface this by saying I have a terrible trading record, mostly crippling losses, so obviously none of this is financial advice and you should ignore everything I say. If anything is incorrect drop a comment below and i\\'ll fix it.\\n\\n# Overview\\n\\nYou probably already know what this is about, so I won\\'t go into to much detail. Back in 2021, Trump started his own company, TMTG (Trump Media and Technology Group), which owns the social media network Truth Social. It wasn\\'t actually Trump\\'s idea, it was pitched to him, more on this later. The aim is to bring this to the public markets via a SPAC merger with DWAC (Digital World Acquisition Corp). Yesterday shareholders approved the merger, and it\\'s set to complete this merge next week. DWAC has been trading publicly for a few years now, soon the ticker will change to DJT when the merger is finalised.\\n\\nBefore I get into the finer details, here\\'s a quick TL;DR of the bull and bear points for those who will look at this post and say \"i\\'m not reading all that\"\\n\\n# Bullish\\n\\n* Trump is a hype machine.\\n* Something something woke mind virus and free speech\\n* Truth Social is a soapbox for Trump, and everyone listens to what he says.\\n* The run-up to the election will generate a lot of hype.\\n* If Trump wins the election, DJT could trade on hype for a long time\\n* In theory, if he does win the election, TMTG could become significantly more relevant, leading to an improvement in its fundamentals.\\n* If the above happens, it\\'s possible TMTG could bring to market their other proposed ventures - a news network and competitor to the existing streaming services.\\n\\n# Bearish\\n\\n* The fundamentals are pure dogshit\\n* If Trump loses the election, it\\'s all over, TMTG will probably go bankrupt.\\n* Trump could potentially sell shares around the time of the merger.\\n* DJT will be propped up by just hype, not adequate shareholder equity, which is volatile and unstable.\\n* The dilution could cause a significant drop in share price if there isn\\'t enough hype to offset it.\\n* Trump is a serial grifter who\\'s failed at many businesses in the past and screwed over countless customers, investors, suppliers and more.\\n* SPACs have had a terrible track record in recent years, espeically those with poor fundamantals.\\n* SPACs are a cheap way to go to market, with the shareholders bearing the cost of this.\\n* TMTG has no path to profitability in the forseable future. It has not provided any updated business plans, future growth estimates, guidance or updated revenue projections. The entire company feels like it\\'s fake, it is not acting like a normal startup would.\\n* The other proposed ventures (news network, streaming service) are extremely expensive to get going, we\\'re talking hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars just to get off the ground. As i\\'ll explain later, TMTG *could* have gained the cash to do this through the merger, but unwound it, making these ventures completely unfeasible with the cash DJT will get in this merger.\\n* Trump is desperate, and backed into a corner. He owes so much money, not just on the recent court judgements, but across his real estate porfolio as well.\\n\\nRight lets get into the details.\\n\\n# Truth Social\\n\\nCurrently, Truth Social is the only revenue stream that TMTG has. I don\\'t know if you\\'ve been on there at all but it\\'s basically a hive-mind echo chamber of Trump worship.\\n\\nThere\\'s basically 3 types of users:\\n\\n* MAGA cult\\n* Bots shilling ED pills and fake gold coins.\\n* A small number of anti-Trump trolls, posting on every truth Trump does.\\n\\nI am of the opinion that Truth Social is a completely flawed concept. The concept is that Trump is trying to make a social media network, or \"big tent\", that will be a town-square that is used by everyone - Republicans, Democrats, independents, everyone.\\n\\nIn reality, Truth Social is a social media network hashed together from open source code to spread one-sided propaganda of a presidential candidate. Right off the bat it\\'s a one-sided Trumpfest, and does not make any effort to include anyone other than MAGA.\\n\\nIf Hillary Clinton made a social media network, do you think MAGA would join it? They absolutely wouldn\\'t and this question just highlights their flawed thinking.\\n\\nYou can say what you want about the one-sided nature that the legacy social media networks like Twitter became, but they weren\\'t set up by a political candidate solely to give them a soapbox.\\n\\nThere\\'s also nearly no unique IP behind Truth Social. It\\'s an open-source platform with no unique features. Other than (currently) the only way to hear Trump\\'s thoughts as he takes a shit, it\\'s worthless. It doesn\\'t even live up to it\\'s \"free speech\" claims, as they regularly ban people for arbitrary reasons.\\n\\n# Fundamentals\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, the fundamentals of this company are absolute dogshit. This company makes barely any revenue, and has losses in the tens of millions. I can\\'t see how this is going to get any better after merger, and they\\'ll have an $18m SEC fine to pay.\\n\\nFrom the balance sheet from the latest revision of the S4 in February:\\n\\nFor the 9 months ended September 30 2023, TMTG made about $3.2m, with an operating loss on that is about $10m.\\n\\nTMTG claimed that in it\\'s current financial year it projects to make about $17m in revenue, although I can\\'t see how this projection wold be accurate. There\\'s not been any meaningful uptick in users on Truth Social, major advertisers still avoid advertising there, and the other alleged revenue streams that they proposed early on (like a news network and streaming competitor) haven\\'t come to fruition.\\n\\n# There\\'s barely any cash backing shares of DJT\\n\\nThe shareholder equity of DJT after the merger will be painfully low. After the merger completes, DJT will have access to the money in the trust. This money is essentially the money that DWAC sold the original DWAC shares for when it initially entered the market before it found an acquisition target (TMTG) - about 30m shares at $10/share - so the trust has approximately $300 million in it.\\n\\nAfter the merger, DJT will have to pay an $18m fine to the SEC as a result of the investigation which concluded last year.\\n\\nIgnore the current market value of DWAC shares for a moment. Let\\'s look at how much cash is actually backing each share. Doing a rudimentary calculation (because we don\\'t know exactly how much money DJT will actually get from the trust, or in-depth details of the current liabilities TMTG has): Lets say we take the full value of the $300m trust, minus the SEC fine, and the actual cash backing each share of DJT will be approximately $2.08 per share. This value could be even lower, as legal fees and other operational expenses (like DWAC expenses, and potentially costs of their lawsuits) need to be subtracted from the trust on merger before the cash is released to DJT.\\n\\nThis low cash backing for each share is very low, it\\'s even very low for a SPAC. In the last four years, the average cash backing per share after merge of all SPACs was about $6.67.\\n\\nNormally, SPACs obtain PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) investment during the merger process to offset low cash per share after merge. They specifically do this to ensure the SPAC can meet its operational obligations, and pay all the required costs to bring the merger to market.\\n\\nDWAC did have a $1.3b PIPE deal set up. This would have given the company an absolute shit ton of money, enough to fund operations for years, and fuel expansion and growth. It would have meant that each share of DJT would have been worth approximately $11.80 - pretty solid cash backing for a SPAC.\\n\\nHowever, they completely unwound this PIPE investment. My guess is because they didn\\'t want the extreme dilution that the PIPE would have caused. The PIPE shares were not under lockup, and PIPE investors could have sold immediately on market open after the merger, destroying the share price. They were given a good deal on the shares (it was a percentage below current market value), so likely would have sold for an immediate profit. Remember this part because it works into my regarded theory later on. Spoiler alert: They weren\\'t protecting the retail shareholders by doing this.\\n\\n# Ownership and dilution - what about the 1 billion shares?\\n\\nCurrently, DWAC is mostly owned by retail. These retail shareholders are somewhat unlike \"normal\" retail shareholders in that they are insanely dedicated. Many of the estimated 400,000 retail shareholders in this will not sell for any reason. Trump could literally dump shit in their faces and they\\'d probably take it and hold their shares. You could say that this retail holding is stronger than in the average company\\n\\nAfter the merger this will all change.\\n\\nCurrently the float of DWAC is about 30m shares.\\n\\nAfter the merger, the DJT float will swell to about 135m shares. The majority of these shares will be owned by Trump, currently under lockup for 6 months (more on this later).\\n\\nThere\\'s been lots of talk about 1 billion shares being dumped into the float after merger. This has even been widely circulated in the press, but it\\'s incorrect.\\n\\nDWAC have *authorised* 1 billion shares, it hasn\\'t *issued* them. This means that in the future, DJT could potentially issue up to 1 billion more shares without having to conduct a shareholder vote or amend the company charter. It\\'s like 1 billion reserve shares sat there if they need it.\\n\\nIt\\'s actually a pretty common thing to do with IPOs and SPACs, many companies authorise shares to be issued later on to raise capital etc.\\n\\nIn any case, if they did issue more shares from this 1 billion amount, it wouldn\\'t be until way after the merger.\\n\\nThere will, however, be significant dilution on merge. On business completion, up to 8,369,509 shares will be dumped into the float, given to holders of TMTG convertible notes. These shares will not be locked up like other insider shares, and can be sold immediately after merge. The holders of these notes will likely do this because they\\'ll immediately realise a 400%+ gain. This is significant dilution, and could cause a huge drop in share price, unless insane Trump mania causes a hype rally to offset it. Much of the rest of the float is potentially (foreshadowing here) locked up, but this 8m share dump is significant.\\n\\n# Trump hype\\n\\nThe hype surrounding trump is real. We\\'ve seen it many times before with DWAC - the insane rally to $175/share was surreal. It\\'s plummet after was equally unreal.\\n\\nThe hype has the potential to offset everything - shitty fundamentals, insane dilution and more. It\\'s the reason DWAC has traded so far away from reality in terms of an accurate valuation.\\n\\nI\\'m sure you all saw this post about the hype, that led to you all pumping up the price of the OP\\'s contracts by like 800% before he sold most of them:\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bikpfj/these\\\\_calls\\\\_could\\\\_be\\\\_500\\\\_baggers\\\\_turn\\\\_1000\\\\_into/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bikpfj/these_calls_could_be_500_baggers_turn_1000_into/)\\n\\nThe first takeaway from the above DD is that the hype is fucking insane, and supersedes everything, can cause the share price to rocket to the moon regardless of anything else.\\n\\nI agree with this. It\\'s possible that there will be a huge buying demand to offset the dilution on merge. DJT could rally to the fucking moon.\\n\\nThe other is the theory that Trump will shill DJT and all his MAGA cult will all rush to buy in.\\n\\nThis theory i\\'m not convinced on. Much of his cult have no idea how to trade shares, many of them are braindead and can barely read. And if you think that they\\'d buy shares anyway, think about this:\\n\\nTrump has literally been on-stage at rallies in front of tens of thousands of his most die-hard supporters, and directly shilled Truth Social to them and they *still* haven\\'t rushed to join. And Truth Social is a zero-barrier, free to use social media network specifically set up for them.\\n\\nI personally don\\'t think we\\'ll see millions of MAGA pouring into the market to buy DJT. Any MAGA who already know how to trade will be holding shares of DWAC already.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Regarded Trump selling theory - now with updates!\\n\\nNow it\\'s time for the juicy stuff - the regarded speculative theory on Trump selling shares.\\n\\nDisclaimer: This is a regarded theory that probably won\\'t happen, obviously i\\'m jumping to conclusions not necessarily found in hard evidence. If it does happen, though, I expect to be awarded a flair from the mods.\\n\\nIt\\'s widely understood that Trump has a lockup on his shares for six months after the merger.\\n\\nThere is, however, a clause that undermines this.\\n\\nIn the [latest revision of the S4](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&ref=318071075&type=HTML&symbol=DWAC&cdn=7df8a564ed5159633ce6abd5829662e5&companyName=Digital+World+Acquisition+Corp.&formType=S-4%2FA&formDescription=%5BAmend%5D+Registration+of+securities%2C+business+combinations&dateFiled=2024-02-14), filed in February, on page 42, it reads:\\n\\n>Lock-Up. **Unless waived by Digital World prior to the Closing**, key stockholders of TMTG (including its management team) agreed to be subject to a six-month lockup in respect of their Digital World common stock, subject to certain customary exceptions, which would provide important stability to the leadership and governance of TMTG.\\n\\nThis means that, at any time before the merger closes, DWAC could waive Trump\\'s lockup for some or all of his shares. Further to this, they could do it before it was disclosed publicly. Trump could even sell shares for several days before it would be publicly known by DJT issuing its first 8K approximately 4 days after the merger, or Trump filing a Form 4 to disclose the sale.\\n\\nAs mentioned in my previous comments, I theorise that Trump could potentially dump some or maybe even all of his shares, potentially even destroying the company and allowing him to walk away with billions. He could then just go back to X to continue to be able to reach an audience far bigger than on TS.\\n\\nRemember when Trump met with Elon earlier this month, and everyone thought it was to do with Elon donating to Trump\\'s campaign? Wrong. I theorise that they were doing a mutually-beneficial deal:\\n\\nElon agrees to ensure Trump never gets banned from X under any circumstances, ensuring he always has a soapbox.\\n\\nTrump agrees to return to X, giving Elon a huge bump in viewers.\\n\\nTrump dumps a load of his shares, pays his legal bills, makes a shit ton of money, gets a much bigger audience on X compared to Truth Social. It\\'s a win win for both of them.\\n\\n**Additionally, I theorise that DWAC unwound the PIPE deal not for retail shareholder benefit, but to avoid Trump\\'s shares from dropping in value so he could sell them at a higher price after merge. DWAC never issued a reason publicly as to why they unwound the PIPE. Unwinding the PIPE is seriously detrimental to the core of the business itself. It means significantly less cash to fund operations for a company that makes yearly losses in the tens of millions with no path to profitability.**\\n\\nThe company will get under $300m of cash, rather than nearly $1.6bn it would have gotten with the PIPE deal + initial $300m share offering by DWAC. I\\'m yet to hear a reasonable explination as to why DWAC would unwind the PIPE.\\n\\nSomething else to consider: once DJT comes to market, DWAC is essentially liquidated. It ceases to be a company, the board is dispanded and no longer work for DWAC, it\\'s shares are swallowed up by DJT. It is **DWAC** that could waive the lockup. If shareholders were furious - would they even be able to sue a company that no longer exists? Would they even be able to join together to file an expensive lawsuit against DWAC?\\n\\nThe counters to the above tin-foil hat theory are:\\n\\n\"But Trump wouldn\\'t need to sell, he could just borrow against his shares\"\\n\\nI\\'m not convinced about this for several reasons. Firstly, what sane lender is going to lend up shares that are under lockup for 6 months. They wouldn\\'t be able to force Trump to sell his shares to repay the debt for up to 6 months if he defaulted on the loan. Secondly, TMTG is basically worthless, with barely any shareholder equity as described above...his shares aren\\'t worth anything and have barely any cash backing them. Lenders will want solid fundamentals before lending against shares, they aren\\'t gonna lend him half a billion $ on shares that are propped up on hype. He recently went to more than 30 surety companies recently to try and get a loan to pay his bond, and all of them turned him down. None of them would accept real estate or non-liquid assets as collateral.\\n\\n[Reuters is also reporting](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/investors-greenlight-trumps-6-billion-social-media-deal-2024-03-22/) that he can\\'t borrow against them due to previous terms he\\'s agreed to:\\n\\n>It is unclear how and when these cases will be resolved. Even if the  deal gets completed next week, Trump will not be allowed to sell any of  his shares in the combined company for six months **or borrow against them**, based on terms he previously agreed.\\n\\nHe likely wouldn\\'t be able to borrow against his shares even if his restriction was lifted.\\n\\n\"The board wouldn\\'t allow it\"\\n\\nGo look at who the board of DJT is made up of: Trump, his sons and some of his closest yes-men. He basically controls the board. The DWAC board is made up of Trump yes-men as well. The fucking SEC investigation was specifically about how Trump colluded with DWAC without disclosing it publicly.\\n\\n\"Why would Trump destroy his own company?\"\\n\\nBecause said company is basically worthless. It has a high share price now based on hype, but it\\'s going to take A LOT of work to get it generating revenue and profit. When the hype dies down, the share price could plummet, reducing hes unrealised net worth. If he loses the election it\\'s all over, and if he hasn\\'t sold by that point he\\'d lose BILLIONS. Institutional investors won\\'t be touching this, so there won\\'t be a solid foundation of ownership.\\n\\nTrump looks out for himself, and he\\'s backed into a corner. Dumping his entire holding of DJT would literally solve all of his monitary issues - court judgements, mortgage/lease payments on his properties, funding of his campaign and more.\\n\\n\"But he\\'s screwing over his base\"\\n\\nObviously there\\'s a risk here, in that dumping his shares on his cult could cause a significant backlash, and he needs every vote he can get going into an election. However current DWAC shareholders are a tiny percentage of his base. If he dumped his shares on them, the majority of his base probably wouldn\\'t even know about it. I\\'m not even convinced they\\'d turn on him either, they are literally in a cult. Remember when he said this back in 2016: \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn\\'t lose any voters, OK?\". Still rings true today.\\n\\nTrump is desperate. NY is about to start seizing his assets, potentially within days. I can\\'t imagine him choosing TMTG over Trump Tower for example, especially when he could potentially liquidate his entire holding of TMTG for an immediate gain of several billion cash.\\n\\n# What\\'s going to happen after merger?\\n\\nHonestly...who fucking knows. It could absolutely shit the bed due to dilution even if Trump doesn\\'t sell shares.\\n\\nOr the hype of Trump could propel the share price into the stratosphere.\\n\\nEDIT: Forgot to add in the next step which will be the ticker changing from DWAC to DJT. The earliest this could happen is Monday. However an actual date hasn\\'t been announced yet, so it could be Tuesday or Wednesday, or even later towards the end of the week.\\n\\nI could, and probably will be, wrong about all of this. Be sensible and don\\'t trade this merger.\\n\\nHave fun regards.\\n\\n&#x200B;'}, {'text': 'Hello friends and enemies, I am here to provide you all with the biggest break of next week’s earnings.

That speed is critical as the 157-year-old maker of Cheerios cereal and Gold Medal flour, among other products, navigates an environment where economic shifts and changing preferences can significantly affect performance.\\n\\nThe change program covers five areas:\\n\\nCloud. Except for a small handful of systems intentionally kept in data centers or edge locations, nearly 100% of the company’s workloads are running in Google’s cloud environment.\\n\\nAPI-based architecture. The ongoing move away from monolithic systems to more flexible architecture has made it faster and easier to connect capabilities across different environments, helping improve speed to market.\\n\\nTalent. General Mills has grown its ranks of data scientists and launched upskilling opportunities in areas such as AI, machine learning and cloud. It’s also evaluating its recruiting and onboarding processes and giving managers new tools and training as they lead a hybrid workforce around the globe.\\n\\nWays of working. The company is making steady progress in its efforts to scale agile ways of working and shift to a product-oriented operating model. The Digital & Technology organization first established product teams in 2012, and 40% of the group’s function was organized into these teams by 2019. A few years later, General Mills introduced “product pods” focused specifically on data and analytics. These cross-functional teams of eight to 12 employees include Digital & Technology team members alongside business partners. The number of pods has grown from four to 42, with more launching soon.\\n\\nOperating model. This focuses on governance, funding, engagement and connectivity across the Digital & Technology group. Engagement teams are now stationed closer to segment and functional leadership to tighten the partnership between technical and business teams and direct investment toward the highest value initiatives. “More than ever, we need to be thinking in much closer partnership with the business,” Montemayor said.\\n\\nThe company’s investments in its talent and technology foundations have allowed General Mills to maintain customer service while reducing working capital, he added. It is now processing data from a wider range of sources to better understand customers and deliver more personalized messaging. It is also in the middle of a multiyear effort to digitize its supply chain, which allows it to pull more insights from its transaction data, improve planning and logistics, and reduce waste.\\n\\nA more modern technology stack has also enabled General Mills to expand its use of artificial intelligence. Montemayor splits AI work into two categories: core AI and generative AI. Core AI refers to the company’s ongoing use of machine learning, which includes thousands of models in production across the company.\\n\\nAs generative AI began to grab attention, the company early on created a cross-functional AI task force to create thoughtful governance structures and mitigate risk. That group introduced common standards for generative AI use as well as an interactive decision tree to help employees understand how best to use genAI for work. source ([FORBES](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevennorton/2024/03/04/general-mills-lays-the-foundation-for-an-ai-driven-future/?sh=51071c51c8f6)\\n\\n\\nWhat does all this mean?

So turn the volume down on your morals and let’s get rich.\\n\\nI’ve been spinning the $WFC Wheel of Doom for a while now. I’ve made money and lost money, but my underlying thesis has not been realized. *Yet*. Let’s get the dirty business out of the way first, I’m in a a truckload of calls. I’ve been preaching this for a while, it’s in my post history, go check it out later.  Below is the workin’-man’s-YOLO-lotto-pick-DD for $WFC. *(If words like “thesis” scare you, there is a TL;DR at the bottom.)*\\n\\n[My stash](https://preview.redd.it/z8aac90g5boc1.jpg?width=1287&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2e9f9895a399884db00fac013ad1e2b4b2108e5)\\n\\n# \\n\\n# Key Catalyst:\\n\\nThis is the shit that could be called “facts” in contrast to the brilliant pseudo-knowledge I’ll be spewing in the next section. There are three key catalysts for the current run up and also setting the stage for the “real” run still to come. In descending order of importance:\\n\\n1. **Dec 2023 Federal Reserve Meeting:** On December 13th the Fed said “Christmas is coming, bitches.” and the market lost its collective mind. What does this mean? Somehow the Fed said .75 in cuts and the market heard 1.5, but that doesn’t matter as much as the underlying message that continues to prove true: *They killed inflation and a recession is unlikely.* The second point is what matters most for banks right now, a recession is *bad* for banks. No recession, lower rates, better environment for lending, all leads to fists full of cash for banks. Huge bump in $WFC price on that news like most of the market.\\n2. **Shares Outstanding:** What do you do when you’re in the dog house and everyone hates you? *Treat yo self.* Right about the time the Fed made the unprecedented move of telling one of the largest banks in the US it is in time out and has to sit at the kid table, $WFC said money “can” buy happiness and started buying back a metric shit ton of shares. [From the peak EoY 2013 to EoY 2023 they went from 5.27B outstanding to 3.64B.](https://companiesmarketcap.com/wells-fargo/shares-outstanding/) That kind of change matters and is a HUGE win for shareholders and will lead to higher highs. If only something good would happen…\\n3. **Earnings:** While they haven’t been perfect, they’ve been *really OKish* to good. The bank is making progress on their efficiency ratio, protecting against loan writeoffs, they have very little CRE, blah blah blah *big fucking yawn.* That’s not what this post is about. If you want to study their balance sheet and earning reports go ahead, *I’m proud of you.* But this post is about gambling a shitload of money on when the elephant in the room is going to start shitting gold bricks.\\n4. **OCC terminated key consent order:** The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency can fucking ruin your day. But they can also make you feel pretty. On Jan 30th 2024 they made $WFC a *beauty queen*, at least for a day, and $WFC went up more than 7% on the news [they finally lifted the 2016 consent order](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2024/nr-occ-2024-15.html) *“for deficiencies and unsafe or unsound practices in the bank\\'s risk management and oversight of the bank\\'s sales practices, and unsafe or unsound sales practices by the bank. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-11)”* This is the one that the Fed, in 2018, said you’re dragging your feet and slapped $WFC across the face with a fat asset cap. Now that it’s terminated, anyone with *half* a brain (most stock analysts) know that it’s only a matter of time until the Fed pats itself on the back and says “Job well done, Fed” and lifts that asset cap.\\n\\n[This is a good thing](https://preview.redd.it/mjdsrswn5boc1.jpg?width=1366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fca01c7ff24ab783684b2216454a1cc29b50b3be)\\n\\nDid you notice there were 4 bullets? *But wait, this idiot said “three key catalyst” WTF?* Yeah, go back and read bullet 3 again. *Nothing* in a quarterly earnings report is going to come close to the move this makes when the Fed deletes the asset cap.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Reading the tea leaves:\\n\\nOk, I promised you a section of *un-provable* bull case bullshit, so buckle up. This is anecdotal information and unconfirmed rumor, you know, the *best* kind of due diligence.\\n\\n1. $WFC stock price has been run up like a flag on a poll ever since the OCC lifted the consent order. For those of you that like **technical analysis**, draw your lines on the 1 month chart. $48 to $58 since Feb 15th. While you have the crayons out, check average volume too. This isn’t just retail/stupid money, these are large positions being built every morning for the last 20 trading days.\\n2. I hadn’t heard an **advertisement for $WFC** on any platform since the “apology” commercial back in 2018, which was very likely the single most [shit for brains campaign](https://newsroom.wf.com/English/news-releases/news-release-details/2018/Wells-Fargo-Launches-Re-Established-a-New-Brand-Campaign/default.aspx) ever in the history of everything. However, now I’ve been hearing non-stop $WFC commercials for personal savings accounts (DDA) and high net worth customers (wealth management). By accepting these types of deposits, they’ll be adding to their consolidated assets under management. *Crazy* if you still have an asset cap imposed by the Fed, or *crazy like a fox* if you know it will be going away before the end of the year.\\n3. Why the end of the year? It will **take a while to actually bring in cash this way**, and the calculation the Fed used to impose this limit is the following: “*the average of WFC’s total consolidated assets reported in line 5 of Schedule HC-K to the form FR Y-9C for the current calendar quarter and the immediate preceding calendar quarter to exceed the total consolidated assets reported as of December 31, 2017, in line 12 of Schedule HC to the form FR Y-9C.*” (That’s from the *Limits on Growth Section 5.(a)* in the Fed’s Order bitch slapping $WFC.  I’d link it, but it opens a PDF and that’s assault in 29 states.) That means they have *some* wiggle room to at least start taking DDA type deposits. Risky? Maybe. Bullshit? Likely. But *I am* hearing a shitload of commercials.\\n4. For about a year and a half I’ve been checking the external $WFC **Workday job postings** for any indication of what might be going on. There has definitely been a shift from risk and compliance type postings to wealth management, market analysis and management, account management, etc.. This is about as close as I come to reading tarot cards, but it *has* shifted.\\n5. Uh, even shitty investor DD sites are talking about it, if you’re into that kind of thing?  Why bother when all the best is in this sub?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# The Buffett Case Against $WFC:\\n\\n“*What about Warren Buffett selling his long held position in $WFC?*” – What do you mean? Do you really think the most successful investor in the history of the universe knows more than *me*? First of all, he sold at the *bottom*, so think about that for a minute. A few points to consider:\\n\\n[This is a silly thing](https://preview.redd.it/49xmp0fp5boc1.jpg?width=1230&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=420fe25a34eb165108f88fc9a9be08c15e2400c2)\\n\\n1. **Warren Buffett sold his entire stake in $WFC** because he has a “fundamental belief” that [bankers should be held to a very high moral standard](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-munger-why-still-holds-164425166.html). The fake account scandal demonstrated that the leadership at $WFC did not meet his very high bar of moral character. So he sold.\\n2. Buffett believed in this enough to [sell 271 million shares below $30 and another 52 million below $40.](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/wfc/transactions) That’s impressive **conviction to moral standards** and honestly should be applauded. It would be more impressive if he didn’t still make an absolute killing on $WFC, but he had to have known he was selling at a relatively *temporary* low.\\n3. **Charlie Munger still owned a shitload of $WFC.** [Munger has a different view](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-munger-why-still-holds-164425166.html), like you and I he *likes money* and has a more realistic view of the moral character of CEOs.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# TL:DR\\n\\n1. “3 Rate cuts and no recession“ – The Fed\\n2. Shares outstanding went from 5.27 billion in 2013 to 3.64 billion in 2023\\n3. This DD is not about earnings or balance sheet management\\n4. **OCC terminated the 2016 shitty sales practice consent order which was the basis for the Fed’s 2018 asset cap**\\n5. Since OCC termination of CO, $WFC has gone from $48 to $58, this isn’t just retail buying\\n6. Lots of new $WFC advertising for demand deposit accounts (DDA) and wealth management\\n7. The timing for new deposits might point to the asset cap being removed by end of year, but probably not\\n8. $WFC job postings have noticeably transitioned from risk and compliance to wealth management\\n9. Popular investment websites are beginning to write about the bull case for $WFC\\n10. Warren Buffett sold $WFC because of personal beliefs about banker’s morals, so much so that he sold at the bottom\\n11.

Here is the article if you want to read the whole thing. Grab some chips (or tendies) cause this is a long read.***\\n\\n#### Intel’s fall\\n\\nThe big drama was the beating Intel has taken in the datacenter, where  they went from a near monopoly position in x86 CPUs to a duopoly  situation where AMD has consistently been gaining share: \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/psz8qlgk7znc1.jpg?width=949&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d1fadcdd88e7d1444671d35c762142effc1f6f5\\n\\nAdditionally, ARM-based CPUs are making headway in the datacenter as  well, eroding the dominant position which the x86 architecture has  enjoyed for decades. Large hyperscalers controlling the cloud market are  increasingly designing their own silicon. There used to be a large  barrier, as all software is designed to run on x86. However, as ARM’s IP  has gradually been expanding beyond its stronghold in mobile, ever more  software is becoming compatible with the architecture. Code written in  major languages such as Java and Python now runs on top of ARM, and for  other languages ever more compilers are becoming available as well. As  the cloud market is dominated by a handful of players, hyperscalers can  easily incentivize workloads to transition to their ARM-based silicon: \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cgsyzppl7znc1.jpg?width=702&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b680e07f5a3826b8f36bc70ec633c4ef8ffcd86d\\n\\nAs a result of these drivers, further market share losses for Intel’s  CPU business seem likely in the cloud. However, the company has been  able to maintain a strong share in the enterprise datacenter market,  partly thanks to its strong customer relationships. Basically, Intel  sales people have been buying their customers lunch for the last twenty  years, and as performance has been less of a factor in the decision  making process for private datacenters, this helped Intel to maintain  its position. Here’s AMD’s head of datacenter discussing these dynamics: \\n\\n*“In the cloud, it’s pretty simple, these guys are buying parts to power  their business, their factory is their datacenter and so they are  driving every bit of TCO (total cost of ownership) that is critically  important. Almost nothing else matters. Once they know that you’re a  reliable partner, whoever has got the best part wins. In enterprise,  it’s a little bit more complicated. They’ve got long-standing  relationships, you’ve got to educate a large number of customers. And so  our ability to cover those end customers is one factor that somewhat  limits our growth, and that’s somewhere we’ve been making investments.  But you’ve also got the issue where the Intel sales guy has been buying  lunch every quarter for the last 20 years, that factor also comes a  little bit into play.”* \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sryve6np7znc1.jpg?width=979&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93c97a225879f2a782e5dfa30e4282f3a9712dad\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, competitor AMD laid out a clear roadmap for their CPU  business. And as their partner TSMC delivered on the manufacturing side  while AMD provided increasingly advanced designs, the company was an  obvious market share winner. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6dlzw1wq7znc1.jpg?width=1070&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08c293bdb532b75d36ae07c04d676854762a1184\\n\\nOverall, it’s obvious that Intel was extremely poorly managed during  these years and if CEO Krzanich had been there for much longer, I think  the business might well have fully collapsed. However, a new hope is  starting to emerge as Intel’s new management is extremely capable. Not  least CEO Pat Gelsinger who has been reorganizing the internal incentive  structures, for example by introducing competitive market forces to the  various business units to improve decision making, optimize spending,  and drive innovation. While Intel isn’t out of the woods yet, all  indicators are now pointing in a positive direction and the company  should at the very least be able to put up a much better fight versus  its competition. On the positive, shareholders are also getting the  optionality on a world-class foundry being built which should be able to  compete with the likes of Samsung and TSMC in the long term. \\n\\n#### Return of the jedi\\n\\nGelsinger  previously already spent 30 years at Intel, from 1979 to 2009. At age  18, he started at Intel as a quality-control technician, pursuing in the  meanwhile bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering.  Subsequently he rose through the ranks rapidly. In 1989 for example, he  was the lead architect on the 486 processor, Intel’s key processor at  the time. At age 32, he was named the youngest vice president in Intel’s  history. In 2001, he already became the company’s CTO, overseeing the  development of various technologies such as WiFi, USB, and Intel’s Core  and Xeon processors. Gelsinger left the mothership in 2009 to become COO  at EMC and in 2012, he made the move to take on the role of CEO at  software firm VMware. As usual, his performance was excellent, he nearly  tripled the company’s revenues and was named Best CEO by Glassdoor  based on employee reviews. \\n\\n#### Moving at lightning speed \\n\\nThe  key for Intel to once again become a successful semiconductor business  is to regain process leadership, or at least to have a competitive node  with TSMC. This is exactly what Gelsinger set out to do in early 2021.  He laid out an ambitious plan to transition the company over 5  technology nodes in 4 years time, culminating in the regaining of  process leadership at the company’s 18A node. This is Gelsinger updating  the market on his plan during the recent call: \\n\\n*“First was the move into EUV, we began that with Intel 4  and 3. And those are done, high-volume manufacturing is underway. So we  took the EUV risk off the table there. Then backside power, we ran an  internal node, something we didn’t disclose to external foundry  customers, but we ran many wafers using Intel 3 with backside power to  de-risk before you put it into Intel 20A and 18A. And then,  gate-all-around transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside  power and gate-all-around.*   \\n*We are first in the industry to have  incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a  single process node, and 2 years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake,  our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected  to achieve manufacturing readiness in the second half of '24, completing  our five nodes in 4 years journey and bringing us back to process  leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel  18A product for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for  desktops will be heading there shortly.”*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe momentum is clearly there, with Intel continuing to sign new deals  for its fledgling foundry business. At the recent foundry day, the $10  billion pipeline was already raised to $15 billion, with customers  including Microsoft, Mediatek and Valens Semi. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ferxy7y7znc1.jpg?width=459&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06c83626738890bdcc4baae84ed9367e692a15e1\\n\\n \\n\\nThe five nodes in four years strategy is culminating into Intel  retaking the lead in terms of innovation. We noted previously that [**TSMC will be moving more slowly to the latest innovations in leading edge semi architectures**](https://www.techfund.one/p/leading-edge-semis-come-roaring-back) than  its key challengers, Intel and Samsung. The current champion’s strategy  is to remain on the FinFET architecture just a while longer at its N3  node, while moving to gate-all-around at N2 in 2025 and to backside  power at N2P a year later. Meanwhile, Intel has a long history of  implementing novel chip architectures as illustrated below:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[ Intel’s innovations over the last 20 years](https://preview.redd.it/744becsz7znc1.jpg?width=1123&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=356d26a2e713e3e507e59e131188065cf3406174)\\n\\nThis is TSMC’s CEO giving their view on process technology: \\n\\n“Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them  lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows our N3P  technology demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A competitors’ technology  but with an earlier time to market, better technology, and much better  cost. Our 2 nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced  than both N3P and 18A, and will be the most advanced technology when it  is introduced in 2025.” \\n\\nIntel  3 is basically Intel 4 but for foundry customers. So Intel 4 is  manufacturing the company’s in-house semis, while Intel 3 will do so for  the external fabless customers. Although the company will then later on  bring its own volumes onto node 3 as well. Intel is using this similar  strategy in 20A vs 18A, with 20A being ramped up with in-house designs  and subsequently 18A becoming the bulk node, both for external foundry  and internal business units. TSMC has somewhat of a similar strategy as  they first scale up a new node with Apple’s orders, which is its largest  customer, and which is then followed by a more diversified order flow  of other leading edge customers.\\n\\nBelow is [**Gelsinger discussing Intel’s innovations with Ben Thompson of Stratechery**](https://stratechery.com/2023/an-interview-with-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-about-intels-progress-towards-process-leadership/):\\n\\n \\n\\n>“PowerVia (i.e. backside power), when you look at a metal  stack of a modern process, leading edge technology might have fifteen  to twenty metal layers. Metal one, metal two, and transistors all the  way at the bottom. So it’s just an incredible skyscraper design. Well,  the top level of metals is almost entirely used for power delivery, so  now you have to take signals and weave them up through this lattice and  then they’re screwing up your metal routing. So the idea of moving them  to the bottom is magic. The first time I saw this laid out, as a former  chip designer, I was like, “Hallelujah!”. Everybody loves this, and this  is really an Intel innovation. The industry looked at this and said,  “Wow, these guys are years ahead of anything else”, and now everybody  else is racing to catch up while we’re already in our second and third  generation here.  \\nWe also had a lot of pent-up innovation. We had  congestion at the integration phase, but not at the invention phase. So I  had a candy store of ideas like PowerVia. Now given enough capital,  enough team, we were able to go quickly into it — bam, bam, bam. So  you’re racing through capital very rapidly, you’re driving the  development teams very aggressively. “Oh, you just got your breather on  getting Intel 4 into production. Okay, you got six weeks to get the next  one up and running and ready for the qualification process to start,  and then we’re six months from right into 20A, and then six months  later, right into 18A”. It’s an incredibly intense schedule, but we fell  behind, we had to be intense, we had to really bet hard to make 18A the  winner and every indication is, as I said, I’ve been looking at  scanning electron microscope images for forty years, this is a work of  art. I do think that there’s merit in some of the skepticism, “Hey, you  fumbled last time, what have you done now?”. Well, I’ve changed the  leadership, I’ve changed the development model, I’ve changed many of the  people in it, and I’ve thrown incredible amounts of capital at this to  go give them what they need.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[ Construction of Intel’s advanced fabs in Arizona](https://preview.redd.it/ce9vay568znc1.jpg?width=787&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bdc306e422179454ab0d04093474641da423146)\\n\\n \\n\\n#### IDM 2.0\\n\\nIntel’s  new business model is called ‘IDM 2.0’. The old and original business  model was the traditional IDM model — i.e. integrated device  manufacturer — basically a vertically integrated semiconductor  manufacturer and designer. The modern semiconductor business model on  the other hand is the separation between the foundry and the designer,  the latter also known as the fabless company. A classic example of this  modern approach is the Nvidia - TSMC relationship, where both sides can  be hyper focused on their role in the value chain, i.e. designing GPUs  in the case of Nvidia and manufacturing them on the latest process  technologies in the case of TSMC.\\n\\nWhat Intel is trying to  accomplish here under the new IDM 2.0 model is to have the best of both  worlds. The biggest change is that its manufacturing capabilities will  be opened up to external customers, i.e. becoming a foundry, thereby  propelling the manufacturing side to become much more efficient by  introducing it to market forces. Intel’s manufacturing (the IFS  division) will for the very first time be running its own P&L,  generating revenues so that it can start optimizing a profit margin.  Under the old model, manufacturing would purely be a cost center where  the various Intel divisions such as client, datacenter and networking  could allocate costs to.\\n\\nThis is Intel’s CFO giving more details on the IDM 2.0 model at the foundry day last year:\\n\\n \\n\\n>“Today our manufacturing, technology development and IFS  groups comprise roughly 40% of our headcount, 25% of our OpEx, and more  than 90% of our CapEx. Yet our ability to benchmark and track the  effectiveness of these investments has historically been obscured by the  lack of transparency inherent in an allocated cost model.   \\nOur  pivot to giving manufacturing its own P&L is critical to identifying  cost reductions. This new model will add transparency and comparability  that exposes the true economics of the business by more directly  measuring the financial performance of our teams with peers. We're  already seeing benefits of this newfound transparency and accountability  and expect to see many more as teams are incentivized to drive better  financial performance.  \\nSince our founding in 1968, we have been an  integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and  manufactures its own semiconductor chips. Intel was tremendously  successful executing this strategy for many decades. We had two guiding  principles for manufacturing under IDM 1.0. First, always maintain a  capacity buffer given our strong market position and second, move to the  next node as quickly as possible aligned with Moore's Law. Additional  capacity was key as the cost of ceding market share outweighed the  incremental capital cost. Unfortunately, this also had the unintended  consequence that the business units could drive excessive expedited  wafers and frequent changes to wafer loadings without economic  consequence or accountability.   \\nAnd we had a rapid ramp up and  down approximately every two years, where cost reduction was largely  achieved by moving to the next node versus optimizing costs on existing  nodes. We had leadership in process technology of up to two years versus  competition, that led to consistent gross margins in the 50% to 60%  range. This was the right strategy for the time, and we were highly  successful.  \\nThe semiconductor industry — and computing in general —  has evolved rapidly. With the advent of smartphones, the digital  network, the intelligent edge, cloud computing and AI, compute demands  have diversified. The diversification of workloads and product lines led  to the development of a vibrant foundry ecosystem. Furthermore, the  industry is experiencing a significant increase in capital intensity as  cutting-edge nodes grow more expensive. Finally, there is an ongoing  technology pivot to disaggregation that will drive longer tails, as some  IP will remain on older process technologies that doesn't require the  shrink that would come from the next node. This increases the  criticality of cost-optimizing existing nodes versus simply moving all  capacity to the next node.   \\nThe IDM model provides four key  advantages. First, it enables our technology development,manufacturing  organization and business units to co-develop the process for custom  product needs. Second, it enables us to get products to the market  faster, Intel's internal CPUs are the ramp vehicle for Intel 18A, which  will come to market in 2025 and enable us to regain process leadership.  Third, the model gives us a substantial tailwind as an external foundry  by ramping our process nodes on internal volume and de-risking the  process for external customers. Lastly, under IDM 2.0, we will have an  increased scale and a broader ecosystem of EDA, IP and design services  that will further strengthen our capabilities.  \\nAs we transition to  IDM 2.0, the manufacturing group will have a stand-alone P&L.  Revenue will be based on wafer sales to the business units at market  pricing, while costs will continue to be based on true manufacturing  costs. As such, the manufacturing business will begin to generate a  margin. The intercompany sale of wafers from the manufacturing P&L  to business unit P&Ls will be eliminated, causing the Intel-level  P&L to be consistent between IDM 1.0 and 2.0.  \\nPivoting from  allocated cost to price will change behaviors within the business units.  For example, it will encourage business units to move to the next node  faster as they won't be burdened by the initial high cost as the new  process ramps. It will also incentivize test time optimization, fewer  expedited wafers and more selective use of samples as the business units  see the direct impact of their choices hit their P&L.  \\nLeading fabless and foundry  competitors combined into a virtual IDM would achieve roughly 70% gross  margins, which is 20 to 30 points higher than Intel's recent results.  Our long-term ambitions are to achieve non-GAAP 60% gross margins and  40% operating margins. It will take time before our manufacturing group  P&L is world-class. We initially expect a negative operating margin  percentage.”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLater on, we’ll go through Intel’s financial modelling but in the  meanwhile, that leading gross margin they’re talking about of 70% looks  high. Yes, Nvidia is currently generating 75% gross margins, but TSMC is  only expected to generate 53%. So when you have a mix of these two  businesses into one virtual IDM, you should get to a group gross margin  of somewhere in the 60s. \\n\\nIntel’s 60% gross margin target could be  doable if the design businesses would be able to generate a 65% gross  margin given their strongholds in enterprise and client CPUs, and then  if the foundry could get above 50% like TSMC, we should be getting  towards a group gross margin in the high 50s. \\n\\nNote that IFS will  have a lot of scale immediately, as Intel is still one of the largest  semi designers in the world. Even today, Intel’s revenues are still  comparable to those of Nvidia, with the former generating $54 billion in  revenues over the last twelve months and the latter $61 billion.\\n\\nThis is the company’s vice president of corporate planning, Jason Grebe, going further into the IDM 2.0 model:\\n\\n \\n\\n>“While expedites provide faster routes for specific lots,  they disrupt the efficiency of the factory network and lower the  overall output, which leads to incremental capital and spending. Our  benchmarking suggests that we expedite around 2 to 3x more than our  industry peers with an estimated 8% to 10% hit in overall output.   \\nIn  the internal foundry model, business units will be charged 1.5 to 3x  the price of a wafer for expedited services, just like a customer would  at an external foundry. As the number of expedite requests come down,  the manufacturing group will be able to optimize their factory flows,  and we estimate annual savings in the range of $500 million to $1  billion over time.  \\nNext up is test and sort cost. As we shift to  the internal foundry model, business units will now be charged the  market price based on test time. Historically, Intel has enjoyed a  structural cost advantage on its test platforms. This is driven by the  high level of parallel testing we have spent years in developing.  Currently, we estimate our test times are 2 to 3x those of our  competitors. Effectively, our lower-cost testing platform was  subsidizing the growth in our test times. By switching to the internal  foundry model, we anticipate to save around $500 million annually over  time.  \\nProduct business units will leverage stable pricing, which  will help accelerate our ramp rates, leading to better capital  utilization and faster yield curves. We estimate this will save up to $1  billion.   \\nOverall, we estimate that the internal foundry model will help drive our overall $8 billion to $10 billion savings goal.   \\nEveryone  on this call knows that it is critical for our foundry business to be  successful. We heard directly from our customers about what they need  from us. Number one, a portfolio of process technology and IPs. Two,  supply assurance. Three, protection of their data and IP. And four,  world-class service levels.  \\nIntel Foundry Services will have the  authority to allocate corridors of capacity to its customers. We expect  to be able to communicate clear supply commitments to our external  customers. The next concern we hear is related to protection of customer  data and IP. We will deliver complete segregation for foundry  customers' data and IP. As we begin retooling the company for this  transformation, we are architecting with a security-first mindset, with  data separation as key in our systems design.”\\n\\n \\n\\nThe cost savings plan as we transition to IDM 2.0 is one of the key  attractions for shareholders, as Intel is still burning large amounts of  cash which we’ll get into. However, if $5 billion of cost savings can  be achieved, that should allow the company to roughly break even in the  coming years and possibly generate some positive FCFs.\\n\\nIntel’s CFO gave us an update on this plan during the latest call:\\n\\n *“Every week that Pat and I spend on IFS, somebody brings up another big  rock of savings that they can identify, because they are looking at the  business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at  it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times, hot lots,  and how much sample activity they use. And the factories are now  hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking  about their capital investment. So I think we'll get $4 billion to $5  billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately.”* \\n\\n#### Intel’s recent foundry day\\n\\nIntel  held a foundry event last week and we’ll be going here through the  highlights. First off, Pat Gelsinger talked about the geopolitical  opportunity to shift manufacturing back to the US and Europe: \\n\\n “COVID was a big wake-up call for us all, an auto factory building a  $50,000 car being stopped for a $1 semiconductor. How did that happen?  Semis, advanced computing is to the world's geopolitics what oil has  been for the last 50 years. And silicon, fortunately, isn't restricted  to where it's found. It's the second most abundant element on earth. But  stunningly, in 1990, 80% of semiconductors were built in the U.S. and  Europe. Today, 80% in a small concentrated area in Asia. We've seen this  long, steady decline in terms of our supply chains for the world.  Nothing should be reliant on a single place in the world. We need  resilient access to supply chains and capacity, and thus the moonshot is  80-20 to 50-50 in a decade, rebalancing the supply chains of the  world.” \\n\\nSo Intel’s P nodes are  basically enhanced compute performance whereas the E nodes improve  efficiency. For 14A, the company is planning to make use of ASML’s  latest high-NA tool:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hod2rvh8znc1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=210908b9132c4ef52305087c3f2a2a665dc3c840\\n\\n#### The foundry opportunity\\n\\nSo  far Intel has secured a $15 billion pipeline for its IFS business.  However, there is good reason to think that the company can do much  better over the long term. Intel will be the first to deliver a node  combining GAA and backside power, and with its process technology  becoming at the very least competitive again with TSMC, there should be  clear demand from fabless customers to also source advanced  semiconductors from US soil. \\n\\nAs most will be aware, Taiwan is  currently a geopolitical hot zone, with the two leading superpowers of  today being bent on having the island within their respective spheres of  influence. Naturally the US wants to see a democratic and  Western-aligned government being in control of the island, whereas the  CCP desires the island to become a Chinese province. Thus, we have a  situation somewhat similar to the 3rd century BC, where the two  superpowers in the Western Mediterranean at that time where vying for  control of Sicily:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wzec224k8znc1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f9b6e3436e064edf88ddb0cf3a35da737bdcce5\\n\\nBelow is a brief model on how much IFS could add to Intel’s group EPS.  If the company can take a 12.5% market share in the external foundry  market long term, say by 2028 - 2030, this business could contribute  $2.1 in EPS for the group. And putting the combined group EPS on 28x,  would give an IRR of 36%: \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mlnnmk3m8znc1.jpg?width=433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79c4c7169e5e1fcc6ca54a6509da3b3c6168fa22\\n\\nNow, this multiple is not overly bullish. If Intel could establish a  successful leading edge foundry in the US, this would be a fairly unique  asset in semiconductors. The trading forward PE multiple for these  unique, high quality assets in semiconductors tends to be around 30 to  50x: \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qufp3rn8znc1.jpg?width=509&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff8720b24b1b1e3ccdc5f6d09c0ff1aa7b142d4a\\n\\nWhereas before Intel would always have to transition from node to node,  which requires a lot of capex, the company now has a strategy to keep  production capacity at previous nodes in place, so that customers can  continue to design semis for these non-leading edge nodes. This is  similar to TSMC where lagging nodes bring in substantial revenues: \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6rcrwygp8znc1.jpg?width=588&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a108feaf149266e8f478ada3de44bea07def3e9\\n\\nAs wafers at more advanced nodes are priced much higher, the revenue  profile will become much more skewed towards those very advanced nodes  such as 18A and 14A.\\n\\nThe foundry business model on lagging nodes  is attractive as once these assets are fully depreciated, they become  high margin and thus EPS accretive. The downside is that these nodes can  be more competitive, however, there are currently only three players  below 10nm which will compete for Western fabless designs i.e. TSMC,  Samsung, and Intel. I’m excluding SMIC here as this foundry is mainly  attracting domestic Chinese designs, such as those of Huawei for  example. However, as they are cut off from advanced equipment such as  ASML’s EUV and immersion tools, they will find it extremely hard to  compete at very advanced nodes. And it is also unlikely that US semi  designers will source from them anyways.\\n\\nThe above TSMC chart also  shows why it is difficult to break into the foundry market, as advanced  nodes are only roughly 50% of TSMC revenues. That’s why I modelled in  only a 12.5% share for Intel, as they can only start capturing share at  these advanced nodes. Intel taking this amount of share in the overall  market would imply a market share of around 28% in advanced foundries  still, assuming the leading edge where Intel is competing will be around  45% of the market by 2028 - 2030. \\n\\nThis is not out of reach — the  company has a $15 billion pipeline already, and assuming a lifetime of 3  years for these products, this would amount to $5 billion per annum in  revenues. TSMC will make around $40 billion in advanced semis this year,  so this would put Intel’s foundry already at around 12.5% the size of  TSMC’s advanced fabs. So as Intel keeps executing and customers grow  more comfortable with 18A and 14A, it is well possible that Intel could  be moving to a share of over 25% of this market in the long term.\\n\\nIntel  has as drawback however that its other business units are directly  competing with many of the leading edge semi designers. If I’m Jensen  from Nvidia, am I really going to share my GPU designs with the same  company that’s trying to disrupt me with their Gaudi GPUs? Even if you  fully trust Intel’s internal walls, you’re still funding a direct  competitor — the more cash Intel generates, the more they can increase  their R&D budget to compete with you.\\n\\nAMD has so far shown no  interest to send volumes to their most direct competitor. Now  potentially Apple could be interested, which is still TSMC’s largest  client and is not really in competition with Intel. This should be big  boon for Intel shareholders. \\n\\n#### New datacenter CPUs\\n\\nSo  the company clearly has a strong roadmap of products on the leading  process technologies they’ve been developing. This should at the very  least put Intel in a much better competitive position to defend their  share in the datacenter market. Whereas the enterprise market should  remain solid, I expect the hyperscaler market to remain highly  competitive, where the company will both have to compete with AMD and  ARM-based custom silicon. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/19wyf54t8znc1.jpg?width=557&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=faf4ad261ab6c44eba4100ae4d104ab58fc6eecb\\n\\n \\n\\nOverall, this is definitely not a business I would invest in  stand-alone, as Intel’s market shares going forward will remain hard to  predict.\\n\\n#### Intel’s AI strategy\\n\\nThe  company has a variety of GPU products targeted at AI acceleration in  the datacenter. Flex GPUs are aimed at visual workloads such as media  streaming and gaming, but can also be used for inferencing. Intel Max  GPUs are used for physics and other scientific computations, while Gaudi  is aimed at AI training and is thus meant to compete with Nvidia’s  flagship GPUs such as the H100. Performance is not comparable to the  H100, but Gaudi is much cheaper so on a TCO basis it still makes sense  for some workloads. \\n\\nThe company is also developing its oneAPI  computing platform to compete with Nvidia’s CUDA. The goal here is to  easily run AI code in languages such as Python over Intel’s GPUs.  Coverage for Intel’s CPUs is already great, all popular Python libraries  will easily execute on these, but CPUs aren’t well suited for large LLM  training and inferencing. Resulting in Nvidia capturing this market.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sb09lasu8znc1.jpg?width=708&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb5317fbf5c18fe24d6af518a96be4020099f2bb\\n\\n \\n\\n#### Intel’s bread-and-butter business, the PC and Notebook CPU market\\n\\nFinally,  we get to Intel’s real core business, client CPUs. The company has been  easily able to defend its positioning here, despite being on inferior  process technologies than AMD: \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vgwt5h1w8znc1.jpg?width=578&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3c87760d91eadac65b6be5ea2423136cfb4a72f\\n\\n \\n\\nI suspect the ‘Intel inside’ branding is still strong and most  consumers just buy an Intel-based PC cause they know it works well. AMD  on the other hand is a brand most consumers have never heard of. \\n\\nAnd  currently we’re getting into a situation where Intel will be much more  competitive on process technology, resulting into a promising client  product roadmap:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/90i8tv0x8znc1.jpg?width=1065&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15d81ef5bf42ddf3fd3535e62db1554f8799053d\\n\\nSo it’s easy to be optimistic on this business, and share gains could  actually well be on the table here. Additionally, we have revenues which  look cyclically depressed and with the advent of the AI PC, there is  scope for an upgrade cycle in the coming years combined with higher  ASPs, as client CPUs will feature a NPU for LLM workloads.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyo2toey8znc1.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1447080c63f8a558aeb27ee5fc73ee79f3534fae\\n\\n#### Financials — share price of $42.7 at time of writing, ticker INTC on the Nasdaq\\n\\nAs  a result of Intel’s struggles, operating cash flows have been heading  south over the last two years with a true low point reacher during Q1 of  ‘23 where the company managed to print a negative number, resulting in Intel burning an overall $9.2 billion during that quarter. Since then  things have been gradually improving although capex remains elevated as  the company is executing on the ambitious process technologies roadmap.  You can also see that on the sell side’s estimates, the company is not  expected to print a positive FCF number for the coming five quarters.\\n\\nA lot of  semi companies have been citing weakness in automotive, industrial and  FPGAs, so it’s no surprise this is impacting Intel’s FPGA business as  well. Also, Q1 is usually the weakest quarter, so a weak guide here is  not overly concerning. \\n\\nIntel’s CFO added some details:\\n\\n*“While  we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product  businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG  (FPGAs).*   \\n*With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and  usage rates, we expect the TAM to grow in the low single digits in  2024.*   \\n*We expect Q1 Data Center revenue to decline double-digit  percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the Data  Center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators  over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to  return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator  portfolio — with well over $2 billion in pipeline — to gain traction as  we move through 2024.*   \\n*Within NEX, telco markets are likely to  remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our  network and edge products.*   \\n*We're confident we can grow earnings  faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven on adjusted  free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of  delivering 5 nodes in 4 years and capacity expansion in support of  external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin  expansion.”*\\n\\nSo bringing this all together, we have  the below current revenue split. Over the coming years, client should be  going into a cyclical upswing again — also driven by AI PC ASPs — and  while currently datacenter budgets have been highly focused on GPUs,  this brings substantial potential for CPU spend to recover in the coming  years. So I actually think Intel’s revenue outlook for the coming years  should be decent.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o6kyympe9znc1.jpg?width=587&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ae907d97a6d17e8ab133a9e66be22ee7e553637\\n\\nManagement is more optimistic on bringing capex down, this is Intel’s CFO at the foundry day last year:\\n\\n*“We  still believe the investment phase of Intel, which is kind of the '22 -  '24 timeframe, we'll roughly be spending a net CapEx intensity in the  30s as a percent of revenue. And we still feel like confident that we  will be able to modify that thereafter into a level that's somewhere in  the mid-20s as a percent of revenue.”*\\n\\nObviously this  would be great as it would allow the business to already turn  FCF-positive again by ‘25, bringing in an additional $6 billion of FCF.  This would result in an overall FCF of $4-5 billion on consensus  numbers, giving investors a 2 to 2.5% yield on the current market cap.\"}, {'text': 'Whats up my fellow degens, I hope your weekend is going well. I had tendies for dinner, and I hope you did too. \\n\\nDisclaimer, this post is full of my opinions.

But fuck it, we ball. Someone told you to buy that bitch so we in it. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThen a real company comes along, enter $TSM. Possibly one of the most critical companies to our modern day society. They make \\\\~60% of all chips in the world and \\\\~90% of advanced chips (smaller process nodes) based on last estimates that I saw. They are the dominating force behind the manufacturing (fab) of the majority of the worlds chips. Top customers like Apple, Nvidia, AMD, the list goes on. It doesn\\'t matter who the flavor of the week is in the semi world, TSM will always have the orders flowing through them to do the actual fab. They go up 10 percent in a week, drop 2 percent on Friday and some of yall freak the fuck OUT. ITS THE END. ITS A PUMP AND DUMP. FUCKKKKKKKKK. Its 10 percent up for the week, chill the fuck out. Its a 2 percent pull back, chill the fuck out. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe fact is that most companies aren\\'t \"chip makers\" as people call them. They are really \"chip designers\" (yea, looking at you Nvidia). That\\'s just the way it works in the semiconductor industry. These companies are the face, they design and sell chips, but without TSM they are effectively nothing. TSM is the chip maker. Yea, there are others of course - but TSM is leaps ahead and everyone else is just trying to catch up. That\\'s how its been.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe design of semiconductors is nothing to scoff at. But the fab of these chips is where the real complexity is at. There is a reason that most all companies decide to outsource this process. The capital requirements, ramp time, and expertise required is 10 fold difficulty compared to hiring some designers to make a chip with a pretty case. There\\'s no reason to compete. Have an expert make your chip for you with all their expensive, fancy equipment, and slap your brand on the top. TSM is that expert. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe world has a fixed capacity to manufacture chips, and TSM controls the vast majority of that capacity.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Pros:** \\n\\n* Dominating force behind the actual fabrication of the majority of all chips in the world. Everything from semiconductors in your toaster, computer, to tens or hundreds that go in your car. \\n* Solid monthly revenue in Jan/Feb (7.9% and 11.3% YoY increase respectively)\\n* Nvidia conference this month will likely give them more visibility and a further boost\\n* Increased semiconductor demand from most companies means more demand for TSM. Not specifically dependent on one customer or sector to do well. Generally semi demand goes up, TSM gets more orders. \\n* Expecting the US chips act beneficiaries to be announced this month, and they are likely going to receive multi billion dollars ($5B?) to further develop manufacturing capacity within the US. \\n* Quarterly earnings on 4/18 will most likely look decent, and more importantly they will probably have a killer outlook based on orders coming in from top customers (Apple, Nvidia, AMD, ...) for the next few years due to the booming AI hardware needs that all come back to, you guessed it, TSM. \\n* In 4 years their monthly revenue has \\\\~doubled. Its public information go look at 2020 revenue for Jan/Feb vs 2024. In general you will see their revenue is constantly booming as a general trend. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Cons:** \\n\\n* Your wife\\'s boyfriend said it was stupid.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Some common Q&A and Concerns:**  \\n**Concern:** B..But what about China! Id rather invest in Nvidia and play it safe!\\n\\n**A:** Nvidia, and many others will collapse into a fraction of what they are today. What is a chip designer without an advanced fab partner? Will you buy cool pictures and schematics from NVidia of things they could make if only they had fab facilities? Will you buy their awesome IP and patents? Put that piece of paper in your PC and see how fast it will render. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Q:** B...But what about China! TSM will collapse if that happens!\\n\\n**A:** Yea, so will the broader stock market. So will most semi stonks. So will the sky when bombs start dropping. We got bigger shit to worry about if that were to happen. The impact of this (unlikely event) being specific to TSM is far overblown. Every piece of tech produced today will become highly less available, and prices of anything with chips would skyrocket. TSM also has Fab locations around the world, not just in Taiwan. My understanding is that more of the advanced fab is kept in Taiwan (smaller process nodes), but they are in the process of expanding, including in the US. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Q:** B.....But TSM is way overvalued! \\n\\n**A:** Is it? TSM is quite possibly the most valuable company in today\\'s technological society that most people never heard of and are just becoming aware of. This company is trading around 20-30PE ratio range and is over valued? Ok lets go buy more BBAI instead so we dont get rekt. Oof, too soon? Go look at the PE ratio of half the companies you invest in and come back to me. In my opinion TSM could have a 2T market cap and not be over valued. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Q:** B.....But TSM is gonna have the rug pulled!\\n\\n**A:** What fucking rug? TSM is up 60% in the past year. QQQ is up 46%. Its slightly outperforming QQQ and its barely breached its previous ATH by around 15% increase (back in 2021 - 2022 timeframe). There is no fucking rug. TSM is the concrete foundation that the rugs are set on. It\\'s always there even when those shitty rugs get pulled out from under you to hold your stupid ass up.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Q:** B.......But TSM will crash at earnings!\\n\\n**A:** Will it? Will a company who is getting dramatically increased orders for semiconductor fab due to a spike in AI hardware demand have a slower year? Forget about the drastic increase in AI hardware, they always have more demand and expansions. Look at what they have done, and what they are doing today. They are expanding capacity and revenue all the time. They are doing nothing but becoming more and more dominate. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Q:** B.....But semiconductor manufacturing capacity is booked way ahead of time. Things move slow!\\n\\n**A:** Yea, so what the hell do you think these companies are doing now? they are booking for the coming years with their expected boom in AI demand so they can have TSM capacity reserved now, and in the future. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nDig deep, get your fucking balls out of your wife\\'s boyfriends purse, and buy $TSM because this bitch isn\\'t a fucking pump and dump. It\\'s just getting started. If you think slightly outperforming QQQ is a pump and dump, you probably have PTSD from your mom getting pumped and dumped, don\\'t take that shit out on $TSM. Go buy more BBAI calls where you belong. \\n\\n* $TSM Good\\n* $TSM Has a ton of room to run\\n* $TSM runs the world\\n* Buy more $TSM and get those tendies\\n* Paperhands don\\'t deserve the gains that are yet to come.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDisclaimer - Not financial advice. \\n\\nDisclaimer - The current time of writing this is beer o\\'clock, and I need another one.\\n\\nDisclaimer - I worked as an engineer in the semiconductor industry for 8 years and have seen many aspects of the process, including having vendors make our chips. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy positions (\\\\~14k in shares, 21k in calls -> 35k deep as of today)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hob1bgs1cfnc1.png?width=1603&format=png&auto=webp&s=e581fd401d6e7c4c6c6edb2d1f2fa45b04083180'}, {'text': \"Sup Sluts,\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nGoogle has sent a WARN notice to the government letting them know that on March 10th, 2024, they will be releasing a bunch of people from their 9-5 enslavement.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ox9jkcnzkcnc1.png?width=888&format=png&auto=webp&s=4700d6193162b4b6f9ea844eb7da1f5cd92a8165\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Bookmark this site](https://layoffdata.com/company/alphabet/)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[For people on Mobile](https://preview.redd.it/9kobbiarfcnc1.png?width=1768&format=png&auto=webp&s=81d3ab68153ba457e4887353e25ebf84a089ad7c)\\n\\nThe permanent layoffs are coming from Santa Clara and San Francisco County.

Multiply that by 701 employees getting the boot, and that is $128,283,000 saved and put onto the market cap of the company, which isn't a lot, but we are just getting started with integration.  I know that is outrageously optimistic and there are sure to be HR staff, Graphic Artists, DEI Leaders, Janitors, and whatever other clowns that google has hired among some of the top salaries in the country.\\n\\nInstead of losing manpower however, it is being replaced by a more agile technology that has a much lower operating cost.

But it has since dipped further, and I\\'ve now been looking at their fundamentals more. Boy was this interesting.... I\\'ve then **cut my losses and taken a short position** instead. I\\'ll try to keep this post factual for reasons that you may be able to imagine, so draw your own conclusions.\\n\\nTake a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FcjoSfDLdk). Here their CEO Brian Podolak (presumably u/vocodia_brian) is making a call with their \"DISA\" digital sales agent. Looks very impressive, right? Now check out the date, it\\'s from two years ago! Man, given this kind of revolutionary technology ***two years ago***, **why haven\\'t they already mooned**? Just that computer voice alone, even without its ability to converse and understand, was an amazing achievement at a time when publicly available LLMs were purely text-based, no? Perhaps this voice even sounds a little *too* human? In any case, the fact that they\\'re still a tiny startup with \\\\~10 employees is baffling to say the least.\\n\\nSo what actually is their AI technology? Let\\'s take a look at [this interview](https://medium.com/authority-magazine/brian-podolak-of-vocodia-on-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-f1aaa8d2a8fb) with Brian. Here, he says that \"we were searching for AI solutions \\\\[..\\\\], but nothing out there was quite what we needed. So, we decided to build our own from scratch\". But no details are given of how they achieved that. Worse, the bios on Vocodia\\'s website give **no indication of any AI technology background** by Brian or their CTO James Sposato.\\n\\nThey have [one single patent](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/086055955/publication/US2023132143A1?q=pn%3DUS2023132143A1) about their \"DISA\", but this document again contains **no explanation of how the AI is built**. Instead, there\\'s talk about a database of pre-recorded snippets. So the answers given by the \"AI\" in the video are pre-recorded snippets? Uhm, I hope they\\'re not, because the DISA responds very specifically to what Brian says and this won\\'t apply in other calls.\\n\\nFinally, let\\'s look at their sales. My research has turned up **no public information about any past or existing clients, even two years after an apparently revolutionary product**. Did I miss something? On Feb 29 (compare this timing with the IPO) [they announced](https://www.autonews.com/retail-tech-press-release/vocodia-holdings-corp-announces-first-phase-service-platform-installation) a deal with \"one of the world\\'s Top 3 automobile resellers\", where \"installation of its humanized AI \\\\[..\\\\] is expected to begin during the second quarter of 2024\". Why not install it already now, and why not tell us who that auto reseller is? There\\'s an ongoing quiet period, but this didn\\'t stop them from announcing the deal without the relevant specifics.\\n\\n*TL;DR:* There\\'s a **lot of smoke and mirrors** in VHAI.

Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn’t happen until this year).\\n   1. They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time.\\n2. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they’ll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns.\\n3. They have historically [paid a dividend](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rily/dividend-history), which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns.\\n\\n# Post-earnings catalyst\\n\\n1. Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it’s so bad that bankruptcy is imminent.\\n   1. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0.\\n   2. Opinion: **Low likelihood** of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on.\\n2. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow:\\n   1. Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing\\n   2. Stock may still sell off\\n   3. However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit\\n   4. As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float\\n3. Option 3:  Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes **a buyback of shares** and retires shares.\\n   1. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand [the current buyback](https://ir.brileyfin.com/2023-11-08-B-Riley-Financial-Reports-Third-Quarter-2023-Results-Declares-Quarterly-Dividend-of-1-00-per-share#:~:text=Riley's%20Board%20of%20Directors%20has,million%20of%20its%20common%20shares.) from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results).\\n      1. **$80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float**\\n   2. Impact:\\n      1. Shorts borrow fee would go up\\n      2. Shorts would have to secure new borrows\\n      3. Shorts would fall into prisoner’s dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there’s **not enough shares to fully cover**\\n   3. Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it’s really only worth buying the shares, **after earnings,** if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed\\n\\n# Price Prediction\\n\\nThis part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc.\\n\\n## Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8\\n\\n1. With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear.\\n2. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here.\\n3. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell\\n\\n## Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24\\n\\n1. Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They’re also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position.\\n2. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it’s more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend\\n3. Shorts **need** **continued downward price** movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there’s not much left of a downward catalyst\\n4. So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I’ve already seen some trades that suggest they’re eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9\\\\/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. ](https://preview.redd.it/91pbjxajzykc1.png?width=1617&format=png&auto=webp&s=c389d6128e75239e214e969ae4f54950f94368cf)\\n\\nI believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won’t necessarily cap the price, just the price *they pay*. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position.\\n\\n## Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe\\n\\n1. With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability.\\n2. However, **if RILY executes a buyback**, then there’s even less availability. They can’t double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks.\\n3. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls.\\n4. **There is no way for 11M shares to cover.** Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky’s the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped.\\n5. This will happen *after* reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see *some* covering or upward price movement.\\n\\n# Ways to Play it - How and When\\n\\nThis is how I’m thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing.\\n\\n**When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to** **enter the majority of the position** ***after earnings***\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*. Reasons:\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n* **Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown.**\\n* **I’ll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis.**\\n* **IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper**\\n\\nOption 1: Shares\\n\\n* Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options.\\n   * Upside: get paid the lending fee, don’t have to get the timing right, don’t need as much upside in price to profit\\n   * Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct\\n\\nOption 2: Mid/Long duration Calls\\n\\n* I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I’m putting some in calls for April / May / July / later\\n   * Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don’t need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze\\n   * Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn’t materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little\\n\\nOption 3: Risk Reversals:\\n\\n* You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls.\\n* Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn’t cost you anything\\n* **DOWNSIDE -** Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don’t get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alaxwd9ozykc1.png?width=1768&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2346fd97829bf7e1374a1cccb99d5cb4b760ddf\\n\\nOption 4: Capped Risk Reversals:\\n\\n* Here’s an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t9yuuoppzykc1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=a10a68173654bef14f4f559d9f3083ea04926511\\n\\n* Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July.\\n* You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that.\\n* You get all the gains beyond 20.\\n\\nAgain, sharing research.

The mission launched on January 8, 2024, and just hours after launch, the Astrobotics team confirmed the mission was in jeopardy. They identified issues with orienting the spacecraft for charging the batteries and a propellant leak. With the unsolvable propellant leak, the Astrobotics team abandoned the mission and performed a controlled re-entry over the South Pacific on January 18th under the advisement of NASA and the space community. Peregrine Mission One never left Earth orbit.\\n\\nIM-1 Mission Facts\\n\\n1.

We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.  \\n \\n\\nIt seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.  \\nNo, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.\\n\\nFirst, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?\\n\\nYou could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.  \\nIt would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.\\n\\nAI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.\\n\\nHow did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?  \\nBecause a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.  \\nAn AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.\\n\\nThis General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).\\n\\nThis general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.\\n\\nThey gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.\\n\\nHow did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.\\n\\nWhy did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:\\n\\n\\\\- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees\\n\\n\\\\- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)\\n\\n\\\\- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)\\n\\n\\\\- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers\\n\\nThe Analogy:\\n\\n„Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).\\n\\nTSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.\\n\\nThe TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.\\n\\nAt the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.\\n\\nNvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.\\n\\nEveryone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.\\n\\nWhat is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.\\n\\nDoes this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“  \\n   \\n \\\\----\\n\\nNVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.\\n\\nSomeone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.\\n\\nNVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them.\\n\\nWhich company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC.  \\nTSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.\\n\\nSo there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.\\n\\nThere are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.\\n\\nSo which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.  \\nDo you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?  \\nThis is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.\\n\\nBuilding a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.\\n\\nAMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.\\n\\nIntel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.\\n\\nAccording to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.\\n\\nNow, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!\\n\\nOk, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:\\n\\n„However, in 2010, **Apple** made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.\\n\\nSince then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ ([Does Apple use Nvidia?

In hindsight it is  easy to see which inventions were extremely successful, but pretty much  impossible to guess it before. With these companie this feat becomes  possible.   \\n\\n\\nWhat do you know about GMOs? Genetically modified  crops were the most successful and most widely adopted agricultural  technology in the history of mankind. In the US herbicide tolerant (HT)  and insect resistant (IR) corn, cotton and soybeans took ten years to  reach 50% of planted area and twenty years to reach 80% of planted  crops, becoming ubiquitous. These technologies were absolute successes  and a fine business opportunity for the manufacturers.   \\n\\n\\nHowever  GMOs came to be in the crosshairs of several green groups who have  conducted a wildly successful smear campaign against them, in the end  several countries have erected legal barriers de facto banning GMOs in  many parts of the world. Perhaps uniquely since the Middle Ages a  technology's adoption does not depend on its usefulness, but on  religious taboos. And this gives a very rare investing opportunity. The  technology is there, it has been tested in several countries (US,  Canada, Brazil, Argentina, even in some EU countries like Romania,  Spain, Slovakia) and it performed well everywhere. It is a reasonable  assumption that they will perform just as well in other countries too.   \\n\\n\\nSo  enters China. China is a huge agricultural producer, they produced corn  for instance on 44 million hectares and soybeans on 10 million hectares  (as a comparison US corn fileds span 39 million hectares and soyfields  take up 39 million hectares). It is an immense market totally untouched  by GMOs, as the technology was outright banned in that country. Up till  now. Chinese leadership has been pushing to spread GM-crops in the  country to increase food security but has seen only moderate success  because of public opposition. The country has been importing GMOs for  decades now, but domestic production was not allowed. However after  several years of running in cirlces, the country allowed some local  companies to develop GM-crops to be planted on Chinese soils. The first  GM-varieties have been planted last year on pretty tightly controlled  acreage but by it is reasonable to assume that this restriciton will be  lifted soon. (  https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-embrace-gmo-crops-gains-momentum-with-new-import-planting-approvals-2024-01-18/  )  \\n\\n\\nThus come the developers. Currently only domestic seed  companies could get approval for GM-crops to be planted in the country,  the two players in this market are Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group  Ltd. (SHSE: 002385), a fairly large seed manufacturer, reaching a market  cap of \\\\~3 billion USD and Zhejiang Xinan Chemical Industrial Group Co  Ltd with a market cap of half as much.  (SHSE: 600596).  You can check  out the GM-cultivars approved in China here:  https://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/approvedeventsin/default.asp?CountryID=CN   Several Western plant varieties were approved for import and  consumption, but only domestic varieties recieved approval for  cultivation.  In the coming years the long-delayed biotech revolution  will reach China and these two companies will reap most of the profits.   \\n\\n\\nBoth  companies are pretty much the definition of value investments, their  P/S ratios are suitaply low (Beijing Dabeinong: 0.6; Zhejiang Xinan:  0.7), Beijing Dabeinong is generating a slight loss (P/E: -40), Zhejiang  Xinan is generating moderate profits (P/E: 43), but both companies are  expected to grow their revenues immensely. Both companies are virtually  unknown to Wall Street, their instittutional ownership ratio is low  (Beijing Dabeinong: 7.7%, Zhejiang Xinan: 4.1% ). Beijing Dabeinong is a  bit loaded with debt (Debt to equity: 104%) while Zhejiang Xinan is  much lighter (debt to equity: 30%).   \\n\\n\\nAnd as you most likely well  know, the Chinese stock market experiences a severe selloff, both  companies lost >40% of their share price in the last year, both  stocks are near their 52-week-lows. It would be a reasonable time to  open positions.               \\n\\n#### Catalyst\\n\\n1) China is finally allowing the domestic production of  GMOs, the agricultural companies producing the seeds for farmers will  open a large and lucrative market.   \\n\\n\\n2) Chinese stocks experience a selloff, these companies are pretty cheap right now.\"}, {'text': \" \\n\\nIn a recent report, UBS shed light on Nvidia's impressive strides forward, highlighting a significant reduction in lead times to just 3-4 months.

They even mention the Reddit user names:\\n\\n Nvidia's Valuation Sparks Reddit Debate: Echoes Of Apple's Innovation, Cisco's Challenges 11:12 am ET February 12, 2024 (Benzinga) Print The technology sector has always been a hot topic for investors, and Reddit is buzzing with discussions about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its potential trajectory. While trading at high TTM P/E valuations of 95, Nvidia stock is a Buy based on analyst ratings consensus. \\n\\nRedditor u/waterlimes sparked a conversation by drawing parallels between Nvidia and Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), raising concerns about the company’s high P/E ratio of around 95. This article explores the various perspectives shared by the Reddit community and evaluates whether Nvidia, with its impressive growth in the chip and AI markets, is still a wise investment. Also Read: Nvidia On The Rise, ChatGPT’s Secret Sauce And AI Cracks Ancient Code: This Week In Artificial Intelligence Nvidia’s Technological Advancements And Adaptability \\n\\nCompetitive Landscape: User normal\\\\_gouy pointed out the key reason Cisco lost ground was the ease with which competitors could replicate their products. However, in the case of Nvidia, the complexity of GPUs and Tegra devices makes replication more challenging. The consensus is that Nvidia’s products are intricate, giving them a competitive advantage that might persist for a considerable period. \\n\\nVersatility and Innovation: Normal\\\\_gouy countered the comparison to Cisco, emphasizing Nvidia’s versatility as a company. The sentiment is that Nvidia is agile and adaptable. If a new technology emerges, Nvidia is likely to explore and capitalize on it. The comparison to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) highlights how companies that continually innovate can thrive despite potential challenges. \\n\\nAdvanced Technology Differentiation: Astronaut100 dismissed the comparison with Cisco, stating that Nvidia’s technological advancements surpass anything Cisco ever accomplished. The consensus is that Nvidia’s capabilities in AI and GPU technology make it a unique and advanced player in the industry. \\n\\nConsideration of PE Ratio and Industry Dynamics: 3LevelACDF addressed the concerns over the company’s P/E ratio, arguing that it may not be the best metric for evaluating a growth stock like Nvidia, especially when its revenue increased by 200% in the last quarter. The cyclical nature of the chip industry and the potential for oversupply were acknowledged, but the immediate demand for Nvidia’s chips and its impressive revenue growth were emphasized. Concerns Regarding Technology Shifts And Supply Chain Dependencies \\n\\nTechnology Shift Risk: TimeTravelingChris introduced the risk that Nvidia might face, not from direct competition, but from a shift in technology that could render their current chip offerings obsolete for AI applications. The uncertainty of when such a shift might occur leaves investors on edge. The advice is to monitor earnings reports closely and observe any signs of flattening EPS growth. \\n\\nSupply Chain Dependency Concerns: POPnotSODA\\\\_ expressed concerns about Nvidia’s dependence on external suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (NYSE:TSM) for chip fabrication. The lack of local manufacturing capabilities raises worries about potential disruptions in the supply chain, emphasizing the need for Nvidia to secure its chip production. \\n\\n Competition and Market Dynamics: GongTzu drew parallels between Nvidia and Cisco in terms of market dynamics. Predicting that competition will catch up, GongTzu highlighted the cyclical nature of hardware-related industries. The anticipation is that prices will eventually decrease as new competitors enter the market, and Nvidia’s dominance might be challenged. While concerns about technology shifts, supply chain dependencies, and potential market saturation exist, many from the Reddit community acknowledge Nvidia’s current dominance and technological prowess. The consensus seems to be that Nvidia is well-positioned for the near future, but investors should stay vigilant and monitor industry trends for signs of potential challenges. As always, investing in stocks involves risk, and each investor should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough research before making any decisions \"}, {'text': \"1. Death, taxes, and pharmacies. Everyone will have to deal with pharmacies & healthcare providers as they get older.\\n2. CVS revenue is stably going up 10% QoQ and YoY. Stably is the keyword here, it will be important later in my technical analysis part.\\n3. Newly acquired Oakstreet & Signify healthcare businesses are growing at 44% and 21% YoY. CVS is cross-selling Oakstreet and Signify Health with 39 million members at Aetna and 90 million at the pharmacy counters.\\n4. Oakstreet is greatly out-performing expectations and CVS is ramping up the opening of Oakstreet offices.\\n5. The creation of Cordavis. CVS works directly with manufacturers to commercialize and produce bio-similar products that greatly lower drug costs. The bio-similar market in the U.S. is estimated to grow from $10 B in 2023 to $100 B by 2029.  Example: Cordavis biosimilar Hyrimoz is priced 80% lower than Humira\\n6. Enterprise value(Market cap+debt-cash). Cash and debt mean something on the balance sheet so we need to account for it. Example: Apple stock would be at a different price now if they had $3 Trillion in cash or $3 Trillion in debt.\\n7. CVS FCF(free cash flow) /EV(enterprise value) yield is 12%. I use EV value because that’s how much the business is truly worth if you bought it with net 0 Debt and cash. (If you want to be 100% technically correct add interest expense to FCF to get a slightly different ratio)\\n8. Before buying a stock( partial partnership of a business), imagine that you are going to buy the whole business and go private with it, then ask yourself how many years it will take to get your money back if you bought the whole business with net 0 debt and cash. For CVS you would need $139 B in cash(EV=95+60-16). The business is generating $16.5 B yearly in FCF. 139/16.5= 8.4 So if you bought the whole business, it would take you 8.4 years to get your money back. This disregards the current 10% growth. $16.5 B FCF is the value creation of CVS, if this was your private company, you can have this cash to be paid out in dividends.\\n9. I cannot stress enough that we need to account for Debt and cash on the balance sheet when valuing companies because debt leeches cash from the business. FCF will flow straight to the equity holders through dividends, stock BB, etc. if the business doesn't have to pay down debt every year, the same as if we paid off our mortgages. This is why P/E is a poor metric to use on high-debt companies as it doesn’t account for cash and debt on the balance sheet.\\n10. Disregarding the stock price, for a growing, FCF-positive business, the business is worth more today than yesterday as they have more cash today than yesterday. So CVS in 2024 is worth more than CVS in 2023 because their business generated $16.5 billion of cash in 2023\\n11. So what happens if after all of the analysis CVS stock price falls another 25% from here? I think this is what separates an average investor from a great investor. An average investor would see 25% red and sell based on fear. A great investor would buy more because if CVS falls 25% from here, the business would be generating 14% in value a year with 10% growth.\\n12. From my experience of analyzing many businesses, the stock price will often bottom out at around 6.5% (high growth tech) to 15% FCF/EV yield, depending on the quality and growth of the underlying business.\\n\\nTechnical analysis. If you don’t believe in technical analysis then just focus on the fundamental part. This is my specialty, I spent more than 10 years drawing Fibonacci & trendlines until I was able to make the connection between fundamentals & technical. I’m putting many years of self-taught experience in a few sentences so it could just be gibberish for some. I’m doing this because I wish I found something like this years earlier so I didn’t waste so much of my time trying to figure it out alone.\\n\\n1. We all have heard of “be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful” but how? Technical analysis is about human psychology, and I have learned that growth trendlines & Fibonacci layering can help measure extreme fear and greed. Have you ever sold a stock simply because the stock price is falling or bought because the stock price is going up? The answer is probably yes. For my technical analysis to make sense, imagine every red bar is fear, and every green bar is greed. I found that emotions buying and selling can be measured with Fibonacci and they are better presented on the weekly candlestick bars.\\n2. CVS weekly channel https://imgur.com/a/QKgIPH9.  To explain the red trendline in terms of fundamentals, it’s simply the growth trajectory of the underlying business. I notice that the more stable the business growth, the more stable the trendline.\\n3. If you look at the monthly/weekly trendlines of stably growing companies like KO (https://imgur.com/a/FI6txaK) , MCD (https://imgur.com/a/PC6dhXB) , you can see their YoY growth on a trendline. You can also clearly see the growth of the US economy on the SPY monthly trend line from 2009 to 2020 (https://imgur.com/a/jbIebzJ) , until covid and the liquidity injections messed it up. The trendline for high-growing businesses will be steeper until the growth slows and the stock price will fall like a rock, breaking the trend. Slower-growing businesses will have a more gradual trendline. The trendline will break the moment the growth slows or declines.\\n4. Short-term, stock price is just a perception of a business, it has nothing to do with the fundamentals. If a business is fast growing, people will want to pay more for it, and when the masses see price appreciation, they will continuously keep buying, pushing the stock higher, creating hype and extreme stock prices, and vice versa for when a stock falls. Example: for INTC, their revenue grew massively since 2000, even at their peak revenue of $79B, their stock never made a new high. (I'm seeing this in NVDA atm). This is why trendlines on stably growing business work, growth is known and we can use this to our advantage.\\n5. Fibonacci retracement, you can think of this as a % discount on the stock price. There are 5 retracements that I look at 38, 50, 61, 78 and 87%. What I noticed is that the higher the quality of the business the less retracement that the stock price will retrace(around 38-50% for higher quality, growing, FCF positive businesses). For simplicity, focus on the 50% as it is the most popular.\\n6. The importance of 50% retracement(50% discount). CVS revenue grew every year from 2015 and 2019, so the underlying business was doing fine but the stock retraced about 50% from $113 in 2015 to $53 in 2019 (https://imgur.com/a/EsxVV15) . There was nothing wrong with the business, it was just greed that pushed the stock price way past its true value from $30 in 2011 to $113 in 2015.\\n7. Warren Buffet has unknowingly talked about the 50% Fibonacci retracement in one of his videos, saying that Berkshire has lost about 50% in value 3 times throughout his lifetime. Link: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeCAAAbbgmg&t=27s)\\n8. There are many ways to use Fib retracement from different perspectives. I have used another perspective to get a price target of $87 on CVS the next 6-9 months.  It’s the 50% retracement from the top at $111 in 2022 to the bottom at $64 in 2023. (https://imgur.com/a/eHN7ZRm)\\n9. Fib extension 261% . The 2 main levels that I focus on are 161% and 261%. Imagine every red bar is fear and every green bar is greed. Using CVS as an example. For the weekly red bar on August 14, 2023, I am extending the fear bar upward and I also get a $87 price target at 261%. (https://imgur.com/a/hTJWzwA)\\n10. Fib ext 161%. Combining the above fib ext(261%) with another fib ext(161% this time) from the weekly red bars on Jan 8, 2024 to Jan 22, 2024. I also get $87. (https://imgur.com/a/oFfvOby)\\n11. In my final screenshot, you can see that I have increased my probability of being right by investing in a 12% FCF-yielding business that has 10% growth. Combining that with 50% fib retracement, 261% + 161% fib extension, upper channel as resistance. CVS has a very high probability of reaching $87 in the next 6-9 months. (https://imgur.com/a/gjN61rk)\\n12. It took me many years to truly understand the connection between fundamentals and technical analysis. If you are new to investing I doubt that you will get much from this. But if it was me, I would save this and take a look at it again a few years from now. With more experience from working in the real world ,managing your own business, failing with your own investments and doing your own technical analysis, you will have a clearer view of my presentation above.\\n\\nTLDR: CVS to $87 in 6-9 months.

Ron DeSantis.\\n> \\n> “The Company is increasingly dividing – rather than delighting – a growing number of consumers,” the letter states, citing a recent poll that found Disney is the fifth most polarizing brand in the world, right behind the disgraced and collapsed crypto exchange FTX.\\n> \\n> “Disney’s board faces a number of pivotal decisions over the next 12 to 24 months as it rebuilds consumer trust and oversees a complex transformation that includes an optimization of the streaming segment, a direct-to-consumer pivot for ESPN, the evolution of the Company’s film studios and a growth plan for parks,” the letter continued. “The board will also once again need to engage in critical succession planning. Having a sizable owner in the boardroom to bring the market’s perspective and serve as one of many voices would only benefit shareholders. While this type of director may not always be needed at Disney, we contend it is the right addition at this key moment in time.”\\n> \\n> The letter also slapped back at the investment firm Blackwells Capital, another large shareholder that last week urged Peltz to end what it called his “ego-driven campaign.” Ancora called the firm’s principal, Jason Aintabi, “a publicity-seeking greenmailer with a questionable personal and business history” who opposes Peltz’s efforts despite having “made billions of dollars over many decades” through shareholder activism.\\n\\nhttps://www.thewrap.com/nelson-peltz-disney-board-seats-ancora-holdings/\\n\\n> **Bill Ackman Jumps To Musk\\'s Defense Over Anti-Semitism Controversy, Pledges To Stay Invested In X: \\'Earth Is Fortunate...\\'**\\n> \\n> Tesla CEO Elon Musk, recently criticized for endorsing anti-Semitic comments and lashing out at advertisers choosing to pull out of advertising on his social media platform, found support from fund manager Bill Ackman.\\n> \\n> What Happened: Ackman, expressing his views on social media platform X, owned by Musk, defended the billionaire entrepreneur’s commitment to free speech and praised his recent interview at the New York Times DealBook Summit.\\n> \\n> “Musk is a free speech absolutist which I respect,” Ackman wrote.\\n> \\n> Ackman said his firm, which invested in Twitter’s privatization via The Pershing Square (OTC:PSHZF) Foundation, intends to maintain its interest in X and support companies advertising on the platform.\\n> \\n> “Whether we make a profit on our investment is not important to us as we never intend to sell our interest.”\\n> \\n> In the interview, Musk criticized advertisers who abandoned the platform over the anti-Semitic content controversy, asserting that he and X were being treated unfairly compared to other social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook.\\n> \\n> Ackman argued that X is targeted due to its perceived competition with other media organizations and because articles mentioning Musk, especially amid controversies, attract more clicks. He said that even Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) suspended ads on X under media pressure, despite its heavy investment in Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok.\\n> \\n> “If Bob Iger would carefully examine the facts, he would likely continue to advertise on X, but Disney caves to public pressure rather than do the right thing,” Ackman said. “I am sure Nelson Peltz can fix this when he joins the Disney board.”\\n> \\n> Addressing Musk’s response to the anti-Semitic post, Ackman, who is Jewish, stated that Musk did not exhibit any anti-Semitic intent. He supported Musk’s clarification during the interview that Jews often support oppressed groups due to their history.\\n> \\n> “And he [Musk] is correct in saying that Jews should rethink support for organizations that seek their elimination,” he added.\\n> \\n> Ackman expressed gratitude for X’s insulation from external influence. ” “Earth is fortunate that @X is owned by an individual that is largely insulated from financial and other influence,” he said.\\n> \\n> However, he suggested that a “carefully governed trust” could be a more suitable long-term owner.\\n> \\n> While Musk thanked Ackman for his support, X is expected to incur losses of $75 million in advertising revenue by year-end due to the suspension of ads by some advertisers, according to a New York Times report.\\n\\nhttps://uk.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bill-ackman-jumps-to-musks-defense-over-antisemitism-controversy-pledges-to-stay-invested-in-x-earth-is-fortunate-3255625\\n\\n> But Peltz’s effort does have its share of supporters. Bill Ackman, the influential hedge fund manager and founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, was seen at the Dealbook Summit carefully listening to Iger, Elon Musk and other interviewees. Iger’s remarks about Disney pulling its ads from Musk’s X (Twitter) seemed particularly troubling to Ackman, who has expressed disapproval of “Disney [caving] to public pressure” regarding X while investing heavily in TikTok.\\n> \\n> “If Bob Iger would carefully examine the facts, he would likely continue to advertise on X, but Disney caves to public pressure rather than do the right thing,” Ackman wrote on X. “Meanwhile Disney invests heavily on TikTok, likely alongside videos of kids teaching other teenagers to be anorexic and worse. I am sure Nelson Peltz can fix this when he joins the Disney board.”\\n\\nhttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/ike-perlmutter-bob-iger-nelson-peltz-disney-activist-fight-1235715097/\\n\\nIt\\'s obvious that literally every single Disney investors/shareholder are supporting Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter/Ancora while BlackWells Capital is barging in as well:\\n\\n> **Disney Inks Deal With ValueAct While Blackwells Capital Nominates Board Candidates Amid Peltz Proxy Battle**\\n> \\n> Disney and CEO Bob Iger secured new support from activist investor ValueAct Capital in the company’s proxy fight with Nelson Peltz.\\n> \\n> The Mouse House also got an unsolicited vote of confidence, in a roundabout way, from Blackwells Capital, which said it is nominating three candidates to the board to rival those picked by Peltz’s Trian Fund Management in a looming proxy fight — although Blackwells called the media company’s agreement with ValueAct “a disappointing defensive move by Disney that does not solve for anything.”\\n> \\n> Disney on Tuesday announced an “information sharing” deal with ValueAct, an investor in Disney, which ensures the investment firm will support the company’s recommended slate of nominees for election to the Disney board at the 2024 annual meeting. Under Disney’s confidentiality agreement with ValueAct, the media conglomerate will provide information to the investment firm and consult with ValueAct on “strategic matters,” including through meetings with the Disney board and management.\\n> \\n> Separately, Blackwells Capital, another Disney shareholder, announced that it will nominate three candidates — Jessica Schell, a former Warner Bros. and NBCUniversal exec; Tribeca Film Festival co-founder Craig Hatkoff; and TaskRabbit founder Leah Solivan — for election to the board of directors of Disney, which is expected to be held this spring. In announcing the trio of candidates, Blackwells slammed “Peltz’s reprise of a contrived campaign that is disconnected from the needs of Disney stakeholders.”\\n> \\n> Disney confirmed that Blackwells Capital provided notice of its intent to nominate the three individuals for election to the company’s board at the 2024 annual meeting of shareholders. Disney said the board’s governance and nominating committee “will review the proposed Blackwells nominees and provide a recommendation to the board as part of its governance process.”\\n> \\n> In late November, Peltz renewed his proxy battle with Iger and the company’s board and announced plans to nominate two directors. That came after Disney named Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and former Sky chief Jeremy Darroch as new directors.\\n> \\n> Peltz’s Trian hedge fund subsequently announced it would nominate Peltz and former Disney CFO James Rasulo as candidates for directors of the Disney board at the annual shareholders meeting. Trian controls about $3 billion worth of Disney’s shares, 78% of which are owned by former Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter (whom Disney alleges has a “longstanding personal agenda” against Iger).\\n> \\n> Jason Aintabi, Blackwells’ chief investment officer, said in a statement, “We call on Mr. Peltz to end his peacocking so that Disney can focus on its bright future, and not be dragged backward in time. Disney’s current leadership is invaluable to its shareholders, and our three exceptional candidates are being nominated along with a business proposal specifying that any incumbent director outvoted by Blackwells’ nominees be immediately added back to the board following the 2024 Annual Meeting.”\\n> \\n> Blackwells’ campaign “provides shareholders a necessary alternative to what would otherwise be a solipsistic sideshow,” Aintabi added. Blackwells owns about $5 million worth of Disney shares.\\n> \\n> At the same time, Aintabi called Disney’s agreement with ValueAct “a disappointing defensive move by Disney that does not solve for anything. Bringing all shareholders a real and better choice for directors is the necessary act that will support the future success of Disney.”\\n> \\n> In response to the Blackwells announcement, a rep for Trian said in a statement, “Trian welcomes other shareholders attempting to help fix this iconic but wayward company. We believe long-suffering Disney shareholders need Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo as independent voices and catalysts for much-needed change on what’s been a chronically underperforming board.”\\n> \\n> To that, Blackwells’ Aintabi responded, “We are gratified that Trian sees the merit in Blackwells nominees given they are independent, have the relevant experience and present themselves without an agenda. Our view remains that Disney shareholders do not need Nelson Peltz or Jay Rasulo on the board; if anyone is needed it’s the Blackwells’ nominees.”\\n> \\n> ValueAct, in announcing its agreement with the Disney board, touted its “extensive experience investing in media and technology companies navigating significant business transformations,” including Spotify, the New York Times, 21st Century Fox, Nintendo, Microsoft, Adobe and Salesforce.\\n> \\n> Iger said in a statement, “ValueAct Capital has a track record of collaboration and cooperation with the companies it invests in, and its co-CEO Mason Morfit has been very constructive in the conversations we’ve had over the past year. We welcome their input as long-term shareholders.”\\n> \\n> Morfit added: “Disney is the world’s leading entertainment company. It has the best intellectual property, sports brand, and parks and experiences assets in the industry. As legacy technologies transition to digital platforms, we believe Disney can lead the media industry forward. We could not be more excited to partner with Bob and the board to help create long-term sustainable shareholder value.”\\n\\nhttps://variety.com/2024/biz/global/disney-valueact-blackwells-nelson-peltz-board-1235860414/\\n\\n...and that\\'s why Peltz/Perlmutter will easily take over Disney since they\\'re the most beloved folks among Disney investors while ValueAct/Iger are the most despised.

But public shareholders care about this year and next year because they\\'re going to be retired in 10 years.\\n> \\n> So I think what Nelson Peltz forces Bob Iger to do is justify the cost structure at the entertainment assets and the TV assets, compared to the revenue growth, which is single digits to negative. And it really forces him to cut costs. I think it\\'s a primary reason they\\'re going to cut a lot of content costs on the streaming side because they can\\'t cut them on the sports side because their rights fees keep going up.\\n> \\n> So I think what Nelson Peltz does is force Bob Iger to, basically, fire more people, which unless he can grow the revenue faster on the, let\\'s call it the core business, the traditional business, he needs to cut the overhead here.\\n> \\n> SEANA SMITH: So Laura, it sounds like, if I\\'m hearing you right, you think that maybe some of the changes that would be enacted by Nelson Peltz would actually better position Disney then for the future, and maybe make you a little bit more positive on the name.\\n> \\n> LAURA MARTIN: I would say that Nelson Peltz is far more short-term oriented than Bob Iger who\\'s a business builder. And I think public shareholders are more aligned with that kind of time frame.\\n> \\n> BRAD SMITH: So with that considered, Laura, I mean, we\\'ve heard Disney talking about the thousands of acres of land that they could develop on, building out more of the parks, resorts experiences in other parts of the world. That still looks like money going out the door. So at what point do you think Disney is ultimately going to be able to deliver on this, and perhaps satisfy some of the investors?\\n> \\n> LAURA MARTIN: So I think this is a tale of two cities right now, meaning that the parks are really healthy. So I think Wall Street is supportive of investing money in the parks because the return on capital of money into the parks is going to be positive. But I do think the traditional, like ESPN linear business and the studios have had underwhelming results, meaning, when the market\\'s giving them capital, they\\'re not actually over delivering the cost of capital.\\n> \\n> So in order to do that, you have to cut costs. So I just think that the economics of the streaming/linear TV business are broken right now for the whole industry, not just for the Walt Disney Company, for the whole industry. So the industry needs to consolidate. It needs to rip out costs. It needs to spend less on content. And I think getting out of India is going to help Disney. They\\'ve announced that reliance. And Disney are in, I guess, a handshake deal right now. I think that\\'s helpful. And I think, when they launch ESPN, the app, that\\'s going to be helpful also.\\n\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/bob-iger-gets-c-rating-170938667.html\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JplnHuRu9I\\n\\nBy the way, we had these news so far:\\n\\n> **Nelson Peltz\\'s Trian to seek at least three Disney board seats, sources say**\\n> \\n> Activist investor Nelson Peltz is pushing ahead with plans to seek at least three board seats at Disney (DIS.N) as the firm is not satisfied with Disney CEO Bob Iger\\'s changes, several people familiar with the matter said.\\n> \\n> During a conversation on Thursday morning with Iger, Disney extended an offer for Trian to meet with the company\\'s board but rejected the activist shareholder\\'s request for seats on a board that will soon have 12 members, Trian said in a statement.\\n> \\n> Trian, which owns roughly $3 billion worth of Disney stock, said it \"intends to take (its) case for change directly to shareholders,\" signaling it will proceed to a second proxy fight and nominate director candidates when the window for nominations opens early next month.\\n> \\n> \"Investor confidence is low, key strategic questions loom, and even Disney\\'s CEO is acknowledging that the company\\'s challenges are greater than previously believed,\" Trian said in the statement.\\n> Shares in Disney, which has a market capitalization of $169 billion, are down 16% since Feb 9, when Peltz withdrew from his campaign to gain a board seat.\\n> \\n> Investor enthusiasm lifted Disney stock 20% in the two-and-a-half months after Iger\\'s return in November 2022 but lost most of the gains this year, closing on Thursday at $92.69 per share, less than a dollar higher than the price before Iger was brought back.\\n> \\n> **RESTRUCTURING, COST-CUTTING**\\n> \\n> Over the past 12 months, Disney has restructured the company and significantly reduced costs. It told investors earlier this month it is on track to achieve about $7.5 billion in cost savings – $2 billion more than its original target.\\n> \\n> Disney said it will work to make its streaming business profitable, build ESPN into the \"pre-eminent\" digital sports brand, improve the performance of its film studios and \"turbocharge\" growth at its theme parks, through $60 billion in investment over the next decade.\\n> \\n> Disney noted Peltz is allied with Isaac Perlmutter, a former Disney executive who was terminated earlier this year and has a \"longstanding personal agenda\" against Iger.\\n> \\n> The company said Perlmutter\\'s agenda \"may be different than that of all other shareholders.\"\\n> \\n> Despite Iger\\'s efforts and Thursday morning\\'s phone call, positions appear to have hardened this week.\\n> \\n> Disney named soon-to-be-retiring Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman and veteran media executive and former group chief executive of Sky, Jeremy Darroch, to its board, a pre-emptive step companies targeted by activists often take.\\n> \\n> The men will join early next year and former Illumina (ILMN.O) chief, Francis deSouza, will leave.\\n> \\n> **SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT**\\n> \\n> Another investor, Blackwells Capital, issued a statement of support for Iger and his restructuring of the company, as well as for the two new board members, Gorman and Darroch.\\n> \\n> Blackwells said displacing these individuals with Peltz and other Trian nominees would deprive shareholders of \"valuable, experienced voices in the boardroom at a critical time in the company’s history.\"\\n> \\n> Trian said while the two new Disney directors did represent an improvement from the status quo, they \"would not restore investor confidence or address the root cause behind the significant value destruction\".\\n> \\n> The Disney board on Thursday announced a cash dividend of 30 cents per share, payable on Jan. 10.\\n> \\n> Disney said it will recommend shareholders support its slate of nominees. Investors and industry analysts are already calling the presumed battle Disney 2.0, but they note it might be tougher this time for Peltz to win over other shareholders.\\n> \\n> Patrick Gadson, co-head of the shareholder activism practice at law firm Vinson & Elkins which is not involved, said proxy advisers will assess how much change Disney has accomplished.\\n> \\n> \"If they’ve made significant progress,\" Gadson said of Disney, proxy advisers \"are more likely to allow for time to complete the transformation.\"\\n\\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/activist-investor-peltz-seeks-two-seats-disney-board-cnbc-2023-11-30/\\n\\n...and Disney announced these plans:\\n\\n> **Disney Reinstates Dividend, Amends Bylaws Amid Push By Nelson Peltz For Board Seat**\\n> \\n> Disney today announced a cash dividend of $0.30 per share for the second half of its fiscal 2023, its first such payout since the dividend was halted three years ago during Covid.\\n> \\n> It will be payable January 10, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 11. The company had said back in February that it planned to bring back the dividend this year.\\n> \\n> “This has been a year of important progress for The Walt Disney Company, defined by a strategic restructuring and a renewed focus on long-term growth,” said Mark Parker, Chairman of the Board. “As Disney moves forward with its key strategic objectives, we are pleased to declare a dividend for our shareholders while we continue to invest in the company’s future and prioritize meaningful value creation.”\\n> \\n> The dividend move comes as activist investor Nelson Peltz, backed by big Disney shareholder and former Marvel boss Ike Perlmutter, is seeking to join the board of the media giant — saying today he would bring the fight “directly to the shareholders” after Disney rejected his offer and named two new directors instead. This push by the founder of Trian Partners has led Disney to restate and amend its corporate bylaws that deal with outside candidates seeking board seats.\\n> \\n> Shareholders elect directors at a company’s annual meeting. Companies list their nominated directors in a proxy statement ahead of the gathering and provide shareholders with a list of the names on proxy cards. Stockholders can also present other, outside candidates for director, not endorsed by the company, as Peltz says he intends to do. It’s not clear how many board seats he is gunning for. Disney’s fiscal year ends in September and its annual meeting is usually in sometime March. It was held a bit later this year, on April 3, as the company battled Peltz for the first time in the early part of the year. He withdrew from the fight in February, before the meeting. Prior to that, he had set up a dedicated website called Restore the Magic that detailed what he saw as Disney’s failings. Not clear yet what he’ll do this time around. Disney said earlier today that Perlmutter has a “longstanding personal agenda” against Iger.\\n> \\n> The amendments laid out by Disney in an SEC filing today do the following:\\n> \\n> -“Address recently adopted amendments to Rule 14a-19 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by requiring that any person soliciting proxies in support of a director nominee other than the Board’s nominees provide a representation that such person will comply with Rule 14a-19 and deliver reasonable evidence to the Company that the Rule 14a-19 requirements have been met.”\\n> \\n> This SEC rule from last year (14a-19) requires all parties use a “universal” proxy card that lists all director nominees presented by both management and shareholders for election at the annual meeting. It was meant to make it easier to get outside shareholders candidates on the ballot so some companies (not just Disney) have been amending their bylaws to make it not quite so easy,\\n> \\n> -“Require that any person directly or indirectly soliciting proxies using its own proxy card use a proxy card color other than white.” The white card is typically used by management.\\n> \\n> -“Enhance the procedural mechanics and disclosure requirements relating to…director nominations made by stockholders, including by requiring: certain additional background information, disclosures and representations regarding any proposing stockholders, any proposed director nominees and business and any other persons related to a stockholder’s solicitation of proxies; and any notice of director nomination be accompanied by all written questionnaires required of the Company’s directors completed and signed by any proposed director nominees.”\\n\\nhttps://deadline.com/2023/11/disney-reinstates-dividend-amends-bylaws-nelson-peltz-board-seat-1235644175/\\n\\n> **Disney Board Adopts New Rules for Nominating Directors in Wake of Nelson Peltz’s Announced Proxy Fight**\\n> \\n> Company also announces first cash dividend for shareholders in more than three years\\n> \\n> The same day activist investor Nelson Peltz announced he was launching a proxy campaign to get seats on Disney’s board of directors, the company adopted amended bylaws covering nominations of directors by outside parties.\\n> \\n> Meanwhile, in a bid to win shareholder favor amid the brewing proxy battle, Disney separately Thursday announced a cash dividend of $0.30 per share, payable Jan. 10, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec. 11, 2023. It’s the company’s first dividend payments to investors in more than three years, after Disney suspended them during the COVID pandemic.\\n> \\n> On Nov. 30, Disney’s board “amended and restated” the company’s bylaws, which became effective as of Thursday, the company said in an SEC filing Thursday.\\n> \\n> Among other things, the amendments “enhance the procedural mechanics and disclosure requirements relating to business proposals submitted and director nominations made by stockholders,” Disney said in the filing. That includes requiring “certain additional background information, disclosures and representations regarding any proposing stockholders, any proposed director nominees and business and any other persons related to a stockholder’s solicitation of proxies” and that “any notice of director nomination be accompanied by all written questionnaires required of the company’s directors completed and signed by any proposed director nominees.”\\n> \\n> In addition, Disney’s revised bylaws “address recently adopted amendments to Rule 14a-19 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by requiring that any person soliciting proxies in support of a director nominee other than the board’s nominees provide a representation that such person will comply with Rule 14a-19 and deliver reasonable evidence to the company that the Rule 14a-19 requirements have been met,” Disney said.\\n> \\n> The SEC’s Rule 14a-19, which went into effect for shareholder meetings involving contested director elections held after Aug. 31, 2022, establish new notice and filing requirements for all soliciting parties, as well as formatting and presentation requirements for universal proxy cards. In addition, the rules require shareholders presenting their own director candidates in the contest to solicit holders of a minimum of 67% of the voting power of shares entitled to vote in the election.\\n> \\n> Disney’s new bylaws also require that “any person directly or indirectly soliciting proxies using its own proxy card use a proxy card color other than white.”\\n> \\n> The announced intention by Peltz’s Trian Fund Management to launch a proxy fight to get its directors on the board comes a day after Disney named Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and former Sky chief Jeremy Darroch as new directors, with terms starting in early 2024.\\n> \\n> Peltz’s Trian, which controls about $3 billion in Disney stock, issued a statement Thursday that after the Disney board rejected Trian’s request for board seats, including one for Peltz, the hedge fund will “take our case for change directly to shareholders.”\\n> \\n> In response, Disney noted that 78% of the shares claimed to be beneficially owned by Trian are owned by former Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter. Disney said Perlmutter “was terminated from his employment by Disney earlier this year and has voiced his longstanding personal agenda against Disney’s CEO, Robert A. Iger, which may be different than that of all other shareholders.” Perlmutter did not immediately have any comment, his rep said.\\n> \\n> On Thursday, investment management company Blackwells Capital, a Disney shareholder since 2018, weighed in on the drama by issuing a statement of support for Iger’s leadership of the company and the board appointments of Gorman and Darroch. “Displacing these individuals or other members of the board with Mr. Peltz and other Trian-selected nominees would deprive shareholders of valuable, experienced voices in the boardroom at a critical time in the company’s history,” Blackwells said. “Blackwells is concerned that Trian’s campaign prioritizes Mr. Peltz’s ego over what is best for all Disney shareholders, and that its latest effort may cost Disney shareholders upwards of $50 million and serve only as a value destructive fog for Disney’s leadership and board.”\\n> \\n> Blackwells chief investment officer Jason Aintabi said in a statement, “Mindless, drum-beating activism is not the right strategy for shareholders. Disney’s board is acting in the best interests of all shareholders and should be allowed the time to focus on driving value at one of America’s most iconic companies without this fatuous sideshow.”\\n> \\n> Regarding the reinstatement of the dividend, Disney chairman Mark Parker said in a statement, “This has been a year of important progress for The Walt Disney Company, defined by a strategic restructuring and a renewed focus on long-term growth. As Disney moves forward with its key strategic objectives, we are pleased to declare a dividend for our shareholders while we continue to invest in the company’s future and prioritize meaningful value creation.”\\n\\nhttps://variety.com/2023/biz/news/disney-board-bylaws-nominating-directors-nelson-peltz-proxy-fight-1235815361/\\n\\nAnd when it comes to dividend, one guy is pointing this out:\\n\\n> they have about 1.8 billion shares outstanding, so it\\'s roughly a $550 million payout. the last time they paid a dividend was 2019, and they paid out $0.88 per share; roughly 3x as much.\\n> \\n> just to put in perspective, disney is going to lose about $500 million in november alone from the marvels and wish flops.\\n\\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/187u045/disney_brings_back_its_dividend_after_threeyear/kbh01np/\\n\\nAll of these are 100% conclusive proofs that Iger knows that he will lose the proxy war for certain and will be ousted and get replaced by Peltz and/or Perlmutter as the next CEO, especially since Iger is the most despised individual among every single Disney shareholders/investors while Peltz/Trian is/are the most beloved folks among every single Disney shareholders/investors. Those who claim that Peltz/Perlmutter can\\'t become Disney CEOs themselves, they will become Disney CEOs because they will fire every single Disney board members and replace them entirely with Trian members and Perlmutter\\'s goons. How? By bringing in a puppet CEO whom they will control very easily:\\n\\n> Pelz is gonna handpick your buddy Igers replacement very soon.

There are people who \"would love to take down the \\'woke\\' company,\" the source added.\\n\\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/bob-iger-ceo-disney-return-insiders-anxious-losing-faith-2023-11\\n\\n...which is why all of these will happen soon after 2023:\\n\\n1. Bob Iger, Pete Docter, Kevin Feige, Jennifer Lee, and Kathleen Kennedy will get fired immediately and Peltz/Perlmutter will become co-CEOs of Disney while the entire Disney board will be replaced with Trian members and Perlmutter\\'s minions while Docter, Feige, and Lee will respectively be replaced by John Kricfalusi, Ethan Van Sciver, and Chris Savino.\\n\\n2. Literally every single upcoming Disney releases including **Kingdomf of the Planet of the Apes**, **Inside Out 2**, **Deadpool 3**, **Elio**, and **Avatar 3** will be completely scrapped for tax write-offs.\\n\\n3. Pixar will be sold to Sony (which then will be shut down entirely), Walt Disney Animation Studios will be sold to Comcast (which then will be shut down entirely), Lucasfilm and 20th Century Studios will be sold to The Daily Wire, and Marvel will be kept by Perlmutter himself.\\n\\n4. Kevin Feige, Pete Docter, and Jennifer Lee will be completely blacklisted from Hollywood by Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter/Ancora for spreading \"woke and pedophilic agenda\" to children. Feige and Docter will flee to Japan where the former will become a producer of **Godzilla** films and other Toho monster films while the latter will become a full-time animator at Studio Ghibli. Lee, on the other hand, will never be heard from ever again. Ironically, Kathleen Kennedy will be spared due to her status as a veteran producer.\\n\\n5. Every single Disney theme parks will be demolished to make ways for something else. In places of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort, state prisons will be built, in place of Disneyland Paris and Disneyland Resort California, Russian propaganda centers will be built to improve the reputation of Russia, and in place of Tokyo Disney Resort, hentai clubs will be built. As for Walt Disney World, once it\\'s demolished, one half of it will be replaced with hentai clubs that also perform conversion therapy while the other half will be replaced with state prisons as Ron DeSantis always wanted. All Disney stores will be shut down immediately and give ways to anime stores instead.\\n\\nIt should also be remembered that far-right bullshitters on YouTube praised David Zaslav when he scrapped **Batgirl** because they perceived it as him waging war against \"woke garbages\". Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter/Ancora will do the same thing for the entire upcoming Disney releases to appease those same far-right bullshitters and spite Iger/Feige and no one will be able to stop them since they will have the total control of Disney and its boards, meaning that they can just ignore shareholders even if they don\\'t like any of those decisions that they pull off. Rermember, Peltz/Perlmutter would be CEOs and the board would be filled entirely with Trian members and Perlmutter\\'s goons.\\n\\nI advise you all to read everything here carefully before making any rebuttals.\\n\\nP.S. Having said all those, I sincerely hope that at least most of these are just my outbursts of paranoia.'}, {'text': 'This is my analysis and opinion on Grindr (NYSE:GRND). I have casually followed this stock for several months, but it wasn\\'t until a few weeks ago that I started researching the company intensely and made it the largest position in my portfolio. Because I have not seen this stock discussed much, I wanted both to share my opinions and invite feedback. I believe Grindr is a deeply undervalued business with substantial growth potential and in this post, I try to lay out my thoughts as to why. Please keep in mind that although I tried my best to carefully research the company, I do not guarantee this DD is 100% free of errors, and I encourage you to do your own research and point out flaws in mine. I have included a number of links at the end as a starting point and embedded several within.\\n\\n# Brief Overview and History\\n\\nGrindr was founded in 2009 as a dating and networking app to connect users based on GPS location. Initially targeting gay men, over time the app evolved to become the world\\'s largest LGBTQ+ social network and Grindr currently stands as the premier brand associated with the LGBTQ community. The app was American-owned from its founding until 2016, when it was [majority acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/11/chinese-gaming-firm-buys-60-of-gay-dating-app-grindr-for-93m/) by Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun for $155 million in 2016. At the time, the app had around two million active users and generated \\\\~30 million in revenue yearly. The app remained Chinese-owned until 2020, when the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment forced Beijing Kunlun to divest its ownership back to a U.S.-based company, citing national security reasons. The company was sold to San Vicente Acquisition for $609 million and remained private until November 2022, when the stock went public at a $2.1 billion valuation. Initially the share price surged, closing at $36.50 the first day of trading, before falling down to the $5-$7 range where the stock remained for much of 2023. Currently, G. Raymond Zage, is the largest single investor in Grindr, owning approximately 45% of all shares and on December 08, Zage increased his position by an additional $500,000 shares, which I take as a sign of his confidence in the company. Board chair James Fu Bin Lu, founder of Chegg, owns the second largest position in the stock, approximately 22% of the total shares. Grindr has not yet received any investment or coverage from Wall Street firms or analysts, and during earnings calls it has primarily fielded questions from retail investors.\\n\\n# New Leadership\\n\\nIn October 2022, shortly before Grindr went public, [George Arison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Arison), took over the role of CEO from Jeff Bonforte, who had been leading the company since June of 2020. George Arison is a serial entrepreneur, and an openly gay man, and prior to his position as Grindr CEO he led a number of companies and was a consultant at BCG.\\n\\nIn my opinion, in his one year tenure, Arison has proved an extremely capable businessman and a good leader of the company. From the beginning, in his communications to shareholders, he has clearly articulated a growth algorithm for Grindr and executed on it extremely well. Under Arison\\'s stewardship Grindr has seen a 40% YoY growth in revenue and earnings as of Q3 2023. Within the 2022 Annual report, shareholder letters, and previous four quarterly earnings calls, Arison has consistently emphasized that Grindr is (still) in the very early innings stages of growth and monetization journey and laid out a roadmap for the growth story ahead. I will elaborate more on this in the next section, but needless to say, results so far have been excellent. Arison has demonstrated a committment to running a lean business as well, although for growth stock like Grindr I do not believe expenses are as important a factor as the top line. Notably, Grindr made headlines this September when Arison mandated a return to office for its employees and subsequently lost a substantial portion of its workforce. ([Reddit predictably excoriated Grindr\\'s decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/16dreg6/dating_app_grindr_loses_nearly_half_its_staff/) but he laid out his reasons and work philosophy in [this blog from October 3](https://www.grindr.com/blog/our-philosophy-on-work-and-building-an-exceptional-community-going-forward)). Despite the controversy, I agree with Arison and believe the hybrid model of two days a week in office, three days at home will be beneficial to Grindr, its corporate culture, and ultimately shareholders.\\n\\nOne additional aspect about George Arison I wanted to highlight because I believe it\\'s highly relevant is that he is a married gay man with two kids and an active member of the community that Grindr serves. To dive deeper into his background, you may read a bio of him and his partner in this [2019 NYTimes profile](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/fashion/weddings/george-arison-and-robert-luo-wanted-love-and-to-live-american-dream.html). I think a strong case can be made that as a member of the LGBT community, George Arison has a deeper understanding of the LGBTQ+ community, its needs, and Grindr\\'s customer base. If you listen to his interviews and read his [LinkedIn posts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgearison/recent-activity/all/), he comes across as very genuine about serving the community. He is certainly more in tune than the previous two CEOs of Grindr, Jeff Bonforte and Scott Chen from when it was owned by San Vicente and Kunlun. (In fact, Chen was so out of touch with the userbase he publicly stated in 2018 that [\\'Marriage is between one man and one women\\'](https://www.thepinknews.com/2018/11/30/grindr-scott-chen-marriage/)) All of this to say that, until recently, Grindr has likely been mismanaged because its leadership did not understand its LGBTQ+ userbase. Under its new CEO and Board of Directors [which is 60% LGBTQ+](https://fhoudart.medium.com/the-queerest-board-in-history-that-we-know-of-b817c44d6d71), the first in history, I believe Grindr will be able to make changes to build stronger relationships with the LGBTQ+ community, which will lead to increased brand loyalty and customer retention, and be beneficial to the business and shareholders long-term.\\n\\n# Growth Story\\n\\nMoving onto the growth story. Upon joining, Arison stated his intention to transform the business and guide it through a new era of growth. Before I dive into how exactly he plans to do that, I think now is probably the best time to take note of the secular social tailwinds that back Grindr this decade.\\n\\nAs of 2022, there were more than 500 million people worldwide who identify as LGBTQ+. Within the U.S., 7.1% of the adult population, or around 18.4 million adults identify as being LGBTQ+.\\n\\nThe generational gap in LGBT Identification is stark:\\n\\n* 2.7% of Boomers (1946-1964)\\n* 3.3% of Gen X (1965-1980)\\n* 11.2% of Millenials (1980-1996)\\n* 19.7% of GenZ (1997-2004)\\n\\nFrom Gen X to Gen Z, there is a 6x increase in the fraction of the population identifying. Although the data for Gen Alpha is not in yet, the trend is clear and I would expect no less than 20% of that cohort will also identify when they come of age, as LGBTQ acceptance continues to normalize.\\n\\nThe global population of LGBT individuals that Grindr targets is a formidable demographic. They are a group with a population of 540 million, a combined purchasing power of $10.9 trillion, and an annual growth rate of 6.7%. If the global LGBT population were a country, they would be a substantial economic powerhouse and a dominant player on the world stage. They would rank [third in population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population), constitute the world\\'s [third largest economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)), and would be the [fastest growing country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_growth_rate) in the world.\\n\\nFurthermore, Grindr\\'s userbase is highly lucrative and coveted by advertisers. LGBT individuals tend to be wealthier, more educated, travel more, and spend more money than their heterosexual counterparts. They are also more brand-conscious in general.\\n\\nTaken together, it is very clear that there is massive value to unlock in this space, and Grindr is well poised to benefit from the rapid expansion of its core market in the coming decade.\\n\\nI will now explain George Arison\\'s vision for precisely how Grindr will do that.\\n\\n# Phase 1 - Monetize Core Business\\n\\nThe first phase of Grindr\\'s transformation, still in progress, has been to introduce new features and modernize the platform, with a focus on converting free users into paying ones. Throughout most of Grindr\\'s existence, it operated primarily via an ad-supported revenue model, with only a small fraction of users paying for the app. Under the new \"freemium\" business model, the shift has been to grow revenue by enhancing the app\\'s user experience and developing additional paid offerings that users subscribe to. Three such offerings that launched in 2023 have been have been Grindr Web, Super Boost, and Weeklies. So far, this strategy has been wildly successful and in the last year, management has had to raise revenue forecasts several times. Revenue for FY 2023 is expected to be around $255 million, an increase of 31% compared to FY 2022. Despite the growth thus far, paying user penetration remains at \\\\~7%, around 1/3 that of Tinder\\'s, meaning there is still ample room for 8-10 quarters of continued mid-double digit (\\\\~30-50%) annual revenue growth if management can simply continue to execute on the growth plan. This initial phase of Grindr\\'s growth should be complete by the end of fiscal year 2025, so for investors with a horizon of less than two years, Grindr is a strong shorter-term investment as it executes on its monetization strategy.\\n\\n# Phase 2 - Make Grindr a Global Brand\\n\\nAlthough Grindr is available to download in most countries worldwide, presently, it derives 86.9% of its revenue from North America. The company has substantial opportunities for growth by marketing and targeting its products and services for international users. Alongside Phase 1 of the growth plan to monetize Grindr\\'s core business in the domestic market, the company plans to in the medium term increase its user base and revenues by tapping into international markets too.\\n\\nThe same playbook they are executing in the the U.S. can be applied elsewhere and will enable them to increase revenue, first in the European and South American markets and ultimately in underserved communities, [including the more than 60 countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia where being gay is illegal](https://www.grindr.com/blog/grindr-applauds-sen-ben-cardins-push-to-improve-human-rights-in-egypt). The company has made it a priority to bolster the positive social trends that are favorable to the LGBTQ+ community in these markets through social activism, while strengthening the product they offer these markets through localization and targeted marketing to accelerate organic growth.\\n\\n# Phase 3 - Expand into New Businesses\\n\\nAs was previously mentioned, Grindr is a platform that represents the #1 LGBT brand in the world. There is no close second. Grindr\\'s platform provides a valuable source of data on the preferences and behaviors of the global LGBTQ+ community, which can be used to develop innovative products and services that address their evolving needs. The unique connection that Grindr has with the broader LGBT community also allows it to develop targeted distribution partnerships, products, and services that cater specifically to the demographic and generate new revenue streams. Especially in light of the pullback of major corporations marketing to LGBT due to conservative backlash, *this presents a major opportunity for an LGBT-friendly brand to step in and carve out its own niche.* Despite the fallout this year, the LGBTQ demographic remains highly sought after by advertisers, and Grindr is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the opportunity. On a similar note, the company also expects to be able to enhance the health and profitability of its ad operations over time, making ads more relevant to users and more valuable for advertisers. One of Grindr\\'s multiyear initiatives is to build partnerships and relationships with advertisers and agencies in order to replace its generic, third-party ads ads that have a low click-through rate with directly targeted ads.\\n\\nGrindr currently operates as a hookup, dating, and social networking app, but George Arison envisions its ultimate destination as becoming the trusted lifestyle brand for the LGBTQ+ community. Already, Grindr has 85% brand awareness in the community, and early trends have already revealed many of its users rely on the location-based features of the app, for example, for safe navigation when traveling as gay individuals and seeking suggestions on where to go and what to do in new cities. There is a signifcant unmet market need for services built specifically for the global LGBTQ community, and once again, Grindr remains uniquely positioned to tap into this market. Although in the past, raising funding has been one of Grindr\\'s challenges and it may continue to be in the future ([although the recent $350 Million Credit Facility announcement is a step in the right direction](https://investors.grindr.com/news/news-details/2023/Grindr-Secures-New-350-Million-Credit-Facility/default.aspx)), the company has ample opportunity for capital-light partnerships with service providers in travel, media, health care, and finance tailored to the needs of the LGBTQ+ community across the globe. These types of initiatives will allow Grindr to tap into a broader customer base, thereby increasing its total addressable market size.\\n\\nMy belief is that Grindr, under new leadership, is transforming the company into a business with a large future growth story. The company is in a strong position to execute on many of its near term initiatives in the next 1-2 years as well as its multi-year strategy for the decade ahead.\\n\\n# Comparison to Peers\\n\\nI cannot emphasize enough how differentiated Grindr is, across several dimensions, from other dating apps. In terms of engagement, Grindr is unparalleled. More than 300 million messages are sent each day on the platform and the average user spends 61 minutes per day on the app.\\n\\nIf that second figure doesn\\'t impress you, here are some other avg daily usage numbers for comparison:\\n\\n* Tinder: 18 minutes\\n* Bumble: 14 minutes\\n* Instagram: 29 minutes\\n* Snapchat: 28 minutes\\n* YouTube: 40 minuets\\n* Tiktok: 56 minutes\\n\\nAs you can see, Grindr\\'s numbers blow every other dating app out of the water. The only social media app that comes even remotely close is Tiktok, which has been called the “crack cocaine of social media”. If Tiktok is crack, then Grindr is heroin. Grindr\\'s remarkable user engagement is the leading reason why I am mighty bullish on management\\'s ability to monetize its userbase. Again, their largest priority this year and for the next 1-2 years (Phase 1 of the Growth Plan) is to build more features that generate value for their users (and for shareholders).\\n\\nThere are several additional advantages that Grindr has over other dating apps, because of its userbase of primarily gay men.\\n\\nFor starters, the intentions of many Grindr users differ from other dating apps. Although it also functions as a dating and social networking app, Grindr is first and foremost a hookup app. Other dating apps like Bumble and Tinder have the fatal flaw in their business model wherein if you are successful at finding a relationship, you stop using the app. In order words, the more successful the product is, the more users leave, and this means that the interests of users will always be at odds with the interests of these companies. By contrast, the better a product Grindr can build, the \"happier\" its users will be. Everyone wins when Grindr creates value.\\n\\nAdditionally, gay men tend to get married later in life. The median age of first marriage for same sex couples is 35 compared to 28 for opposite sex couples. This benefits Grindr in two ways: 1) It means Grindr\\'s customer base has a substantially (\\\\~70%) longer active period than other dating apps and 2) Its users will likely be more willing/capable to pay for services compared to dating apps like Tinder whose userbase tends to consist of broke college students (I\\'m overgeneralizing about Tinder slightly, but not by much).\\n\\nPresently, around 7% of Grindr users pay for the app, which is less than half the rate of Tinder (\\\\~18%). I believe that throughout 2024, Grindr\\'s will approach Tinder\\'s user penetration, then in subsequent years surpass it and continue rising. (Keep in mind, the large majority of Grindr\\'s userbase is men, who are 22 times more likely to become paid users of a dating app than women are.) It\\'s hard to predict where the terminal rate will end up, but I think a scenario where it settles at 40-50% or possibly even higher is very plausible. If those numbers seem lofty, note that 71% percent of Amazon users pay for Prime ($14.99 per month) and 40% of Spotify\\'s users pay for Premium ($10.99 per month). With these comparisons, I\\'m not trying to suggest in any way that Grindr is a peer or competitor to Spotify/Amazon, just illustrating the fact that users are willing to pay for subscriptions when they are offered a valuable service in return. In fact, I believe Grindr\\'s annual revenue per user has the potential to be larger than a service like Spotify\\'s because music streaming services are largely undifferentiated and there is no competitive moat.\\n\\nCurrently, Grindr\\'s lowest pricing tier costs $19.99/month and its highest is $39.99/month. These are ballpark numbers, but given its growth rate in both total users and paying user fraction, it\\'s very plausible that Grindr could have 10 million paying customers just for its core app by 2030, each paying anywhere from $200-$400 a year. This is why I believe management when they say they are in the very very early stages of Grindr\\'s monetization journey. The numbers I laid out are of course all dependent on how competent Grindr leadership is, but I believe they can execute. If the monetization strategy is successful, with Grindr\\'s margins it will be a $30B stock by that time. !RemindMe 6 years.\\n\\nThe last point to bring up about Grindr in relation to its peers is that it has the potential to laterally expand its business in a way that other dating apps cannot. Nobody will ever use Tinder to get in touch with a family planner who specializes in the complex legal and financial challenges that same-sex couples face when adopting. Or finding a surrogate. Nobody\\'s getting on Bumble to find a caregiver who\\'s compassionate towards the unique health needs of members of the LGBTQ community. Nobody is ever going to use Hinge as a trusted LGBTQ-friendly travel hub. This ties back to Phase III of George Arison\\'s growth strategy. As Grindr continues to grow, it can continue to expand beyond its core offering explore new features, products, and services that cater to different needs and preferences of its community. Because Grindr has significant ties to its community and because its userbase is so engaged, this provides an opportunity for the company to expand beyond just a dating app and provide adjacent products and services to the community that it serves.\\n\\nGeorge Arison has said he envisions Grindr as the [\\'gay super-app\\'](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/23/grindr-went-public-7-months-ago-heres-whats-happened-since.html). If he can pull that off, the sky\\'s the limit.\\n\\nAll in all, Grindr truly is in a category of its own, for many reasons, most of which are not even close to being priced in. I believe $GRND\\'s outperformance compared to other publicly traded peers like Tinder ($MTCH) and Bumble ($BMBL) is the market slowly coming to appreciate this fact.\\n\\n# Financials and Valuation\\n\\nAs I just alluded to, I think Grindr (1.4B m cap) is ridiculously cheap compared to its peers: Bumble (2.9B m cap) and Tinder (9.5B m cap).\\n\\nHow does it look in isolation though?\\n\\nGrindr\\'s Q3 earnings were arguably their best yet, showing a 40% CAGR revenue growth rate and a 50% adjusted EBITDA CAGR since since 2016. They raised revenue guidance several times this year, and revenue for FY 2023 is expected to be $255M.\\n\\nIncome-wise, the stock had a net loss of 437k in Q3 so it basically broke even. However, in this quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by a large one-off severance payment as a result of Grindr\\'s return to office layoffs and a large interest expense that will be lower in the future. Q2 Net Income was $22.3 Million and Q1 Net Income was ($32.9 Million).\\n\\nGrindr presently has 347M in debt and 30M in cash on its balance sheet.\\n\\nI believe one of the largest obstacles holding Grindr back before, and the reason it was trading at a discount, was its debt at a high interest rate. In Q4 of 2022, just the interest expense alone constituted was 37.7% ! of revenue. However, its debt situtation is rapidly improving and will continue to do so as its grows its top line and interest rates normalize. Additionally, on November 29th, [Grindr announced it had refinanced its debt](https://investors.grindr.com/news/news-details/2023/Grindr-Secures-New-350-Million-Credit-Facility/default.aspx) with a new $350M Term Loan A and Revolver facility. This has the effect of reducing net interest expense by \\\\~$17M next year.\\n\\nI expect Grindr to post breakeven or post a small profit for FY 2023. The company has attained borderline profitability during the challenging fiscal conditions of the last year, and it is in a strong financial position moving foward.\\n\\nLooking ahead, we already know Grindr has the potential to become extremely profitable in the future, and recent debt refinancing will help to accelerate the timeline. Already, when taking into account the company\\'s reduction in headcount, the decrease in net interest expense with the new terms on the debt, and revenue growth, GRND is trading at a forward P/E of 14 which I believe is extremely cheap for a software company with a 40% revenue growth rate.\\n\\nIts current revenue multiple of 6x is another indication the stock is undervalued. For comparison, Crowdstrike ($CRWD) and Snowflake ($SNOW), two other tech stocks I follow, also have a 40% revenue growth rate year-over-year and they trade at a 21x revenue multiple. If a similar valuation metric were to be applied to GRND, the market cap would be 5 Billion or $30/share. GRND currently trades at $8.15, with the share price trending up 36% in the last month since earnings, so there\\'s substantial for share price to appreciate in this year and into 2024.\\n\\nAgain, I believe there is a strong case that with just the current numbers alone, and not factoring in future growth, the stock is fairly valued at $30/share or 5B market cap which is my price target for 2024. Long term, with Arison at the helm, I believe GRND could be be one of the great stocks of the decade for the reasons I have outlined in previous sections above.\\n\\n# Bear Case\\n\\nNo Grindr DD would be complete without the gay bear case. As a young, unproven, and undiversified business Grindr is inherently riskier to invest in than, say, a blue chip like Apple or Microsoft.\\n\\nOne risk is that although Grindr enjoys powerful network effects as the #1 LGBT platform, there are other apps in the space like Archer, Scruff, and Sniffies. It\\'s possible a rival could emerge and outcompete Grindr, but over the last year Grindr\\'s new managment have proven themselves to be highly capable, and they\\'d have to fumble pretty hard to let go of their economic moat. [George Arison has also made it clear that Grindr will be first to market with incorporating generative AI into the platform.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-14/grindr-lgbtq-dating-app-to-add-ai-wingman-chatbot) It\\'s something to keep an eye out for, but at this time I am not too concerned that a competitor arises to usurp Grindr\\'s position as the lead dating/hookup app for the LGBTQ community. Additionally, the industry is not a winner-take-all market, so several different platforms can coexist at the same time.\\n\\nIt could be argued, and it has been argued, that the online dating app market has been saturated. I don\\'t believe this to be true, either. As I detailed above, there is substantial opporunity to grow total user count and revenue per user. Grindr is still in the very early phases of its monetization journey.\\n\\nGrindr has a somewhat high debt relative to to its cash position. However, the company is liquid, not in any chance of bankruptcy, and moving forwarded its debt payments will be substantially lowered due to the debt refinancing.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nI have been diligently researching GRND for several weeks. Please also do your own DD as well. This post wound up being longer than what I had originally set out to write, but the more I researched and learned about this stock the more I felt compelled to include.

Share lockup expires on 3.12.24, and a lot of regards here are waiting until then to buy puts. They will miss out on **HUGE** gains. The play is: ~~FDs~~ **OTM puts expiring 12/15**. I will explain why in this post:\\n\\n(Skip to end for TL;DR if you can\\'t read -- this is long)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**1. Fundamentals**\\n\\nARM has not mooned **40%** from its lows because of its fundamentals.\\n\\nPE Ratio: 172.4\\n\\nForward PE: 66.3 - Over 2.5x NVDAs FW PE.\\n\\nForward PS: 21.6 -- This one is especially regarded.\\n\\nPrice/Book - 14.4\\n\\nA rudimentary look into their numbers shows that the company is probably overvalued by 60-70%. High margin tech companies (which ARM is not) have a trailing Price/Sales of around 6-7. I\\'d expect that it will probably dump under $25/share by the end of 2024, at MINIMUM. Because things get even worse from here.\\n\\nMost IPOs have prospects of incredible growth, which shrouds their suspect fundamentals.

They have potential to expand more in this market, but they aren\\'t projecting that they\\'ll be able to do so. \\n\\n\\\\^ All from their F-1. \\n\\nBecause ARMs chips are traditionally more efficient and thus have less power than Intel\\'s x86 architecture, they don\\'t have the current ability to expand in these more lucrative markets that require beefier processors. They already completely control the market in smartphones -- which would be good for them, **if they actually made money off it:**\\n\\n[Apple makes up less than 5% of Arm\\'s revenue, and Arm can\\'t do anything about it - 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/29/apple-arm-licensing-revenue/) \\n\\nSome highlights:\\n\\n\"Despite Apple’s reliance on Arm as the instruction set for iPhone chips, **Arm earns less than 5% of its annual revenue from Apple**.\"\\n\\n\"Apple pays Arm “**less than 30 cents per device** for the right to use Arm-based chips in the hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple Watches it sells each year\"\\n\\n\"At one point, Son called Apple CEO Tim Cook to tell him Arm would be raising prices for all its major smartphone and chip customers. **Cook’s team reassured him that Arm couldn’t raise fees, because the companies’ contract at the time lasted through 2028**. Son backed off. Since then, Apple and Arm have been through several rounds of negotiations that have kept the financial terms of Apple’s deal largely in place, people familiar with the matter said.\" \\n\\nYep, that\\'s Masayoshi Son, trying to fuck up yet another company. \\n\\nARM\\'s business model is DOGSHIT. They make miniscule amounts off of incredibly lucrative technology, AND THEY CAN\\'T CHANGE THAT. They have no leverage, because all of their deals are already in place. *And here\\'s the kicker:*\\n\\n**\"In the meantime, Apple has explored the long-term possibility of using a competing technology in the chips for its devices, according to one former Apple employee.\"**\\n\\nThey are talking about **RISC-V** \\\\-- the OPEN-SOURCE architecture BASED OFF ARM (Advanced **RISC** Machines) architecture. \"RISC-V is provided under royalty-free open-source licenses\" (Wikipedia). \\n\\nIn simple terms: ARM is a monopoly, but in the future (think 8-15 years) they will be **DISPLACED BY ROYALTY FREE OPEN-SOURCE LICENSING.** Why the fuck would you want to own this company long term, when they will become irrelevant in a decade? This is a ticking time bomb.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**2. Gy-na**\\n\\nI\\'ll keep this part more succinct. ARM DOESN\\'T OWN ARM China, from which they get **25%** **of their revenue**:  [Arm\\'s China relationship complicates IPO | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/arms-china-relationship-complicates-ipo-2023-08-22/) \\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\n**\"Arm itself holds an effective interest of only 4.8% in Arm China.\"**\\n\\n\"Arm said in its filings that \"in the past, **we have received late payments** from Arm China and have **had to expend company resources to obtain payments from Arm China**.\"\"\\n\\n\"24% of revenue came from Arm China in the fiscal year ended March 31, but **40% of accounts receivable were attributed to China**, meaning **Arm has still not been paid** for all products sold in China.\"\\n\\nSo, ARM China is a separate entity despite the name, and they only pay ARM when they feel like it. ARM literally has to pay debt collectors to fly over and get ARM China to fork over money. **What happens when ARM China decides that they don\\'t want to pay at all?** \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**3. Timing**\\n\\nI hope I\\'ve established that ARM is a complete dumpster fire. But this could go higher short-term, right? Why am I saying that the stock will dump this specific week?\\n\\nThe Oompa Loompas on stocktwits are disgustingly bullish on this stock. They had been waiting for yesterday -- a breakout above the closing price on IPO day -- as an entry point (despite the fact that there has already been a substantial move up). Well, how did they enter? \\n\\n[Huge call volume coincided with 8&#37; pump on 12\\\\/8](https://preview.redd.it/8fx24f6uhc5c1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=78fbd787ba00b9cdb505e4bce030e9e05a9533e5)\\n\\nI\\'ll tell you how: they all bought calls **expiring this week**. In fact, that alone is likely what caused the breakout, as options sellers had to hedge against these morons piling in. \\n\\nAs we all know, options are a zero-sum game. You regards especially know full well that options sellers usually come out on top -- why not take their side for once? Now that dumb money has all jumped into the same boat, they\\'ll sink it. \\n\\nThere are a couple technical lines of interest. The support at $61 (closing price on 9/15) is support. That will break. There\\'s another at $60, and that may hold for this week. But if it fails, this is drilling to $55 -- a long term resistance before the initial breakout, which is conveniently also max pain.\\n\\n(Additionally, I expect the broader market to fall this week due to FOMC / dot plot not showing as many cuts as the market wants / Hawkish Powell. This is a nice way to combine two theses.)\\n\\n[Fun with Crayons: First exit under $61, but $55 is possible.](https://preview.redd.it/xm3zqcs6lc5c1.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=5329aa8bd85735f628a314d34957268f62bf1a64)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**4.

I honestly think that the 50s are possible, but this stock has a really fucking high beta and it could have a dead cat bounce -- so you should sell some when it breaks $61. \\n\\nBuying at open is the best strategy, as this thing has been making its daily move in the first hour(s) of the day recently. However, I also wouldn\\'t be surprised if it goes sideways/up on Monday/Tuesday, so there\\'s potential to just wait until Tuesday close to buy. CPI fuckery is what I\\'m specifically worried about.

(DELL) is projected to release financial results for its fiscal 2024 third quarter, today after the closing bell. Analysts expect the company to post quarterly earnings at $1.46 per share, down from year-ago earnings of $2.30 per share. The company’s revenue might come in the range of $22.5-$23.5 billion for the latest quarter, this is also a decrease from the year prior. However, according to seeking alpha, DELL has beaten EPS estimates 100% of the time over the last 2 years and has beaten revenue estimates 88% of the time. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 12 upward revisions and 3 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 12 upward revisions and 0 downward.\\n\\nDell expects both Client Solutions Group (CSG) and Infrastructure Solutions Group revenues to be roughly flat sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter. Continued sluggish IT spending by corporate and global enterprise customers is expected to have hurt top-line growth.\\n\\nBut wait, there's more. Dell's also getting smacked around by some nasty currency exchange rates. They're expecting a slight hit on their revenues because of this. Ouch.\\n\\nBut now, let's talk PCs. Demand's kinda meh right now. Gartner's spitting out some numbers saying worldwide PC shipments dipped 9% year-over-year in Q3 2023, down to about 64.279 million units. Dell's sitting in the third spot in the PC market race, behind Lenovo and HP, but hey, at least they're ahead of Apple.\\n\\nThis company shipped 10.32 million units, witnessing a 14.2% year-over-year decline in the third quarter of 2023, per the Gartner report. Just for comparison: Lenovo, HP and Apple shipped 16.146 million, 13.531 million and 6.266 million units, respectively.\\n\\nKeep in mind, DELL is expected to benefit from the generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) boom as big tech increasingly invests in it. Dell's getting a piece of that sweet AI pie, diving headfirst into this generative AI craze. Dell’s expanding Generative AI solutions portfolio is expected to have accelerated top-line growth. They've got this thing called Dell Validated Design for Generative AI with NVIDIA, it offers pre-trained models that extract intelligence from data, sparing enterprises from building models from scratch.\\n\\nDell Validated Designs for Generative AI now supports both model tuning and inferencing. The solution is supported by the Dell PowerEdge XE9680 AI server or the Dell PowerEdge XE8640, with a choice of NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, which offers frameworks, pre-trained models and development tools, such as the NVIDIA NeMo framework and Dell software.\\n\\nI'm going to grab calls, because I'm expecting a turn-around in sales and them to beat expectations once again. I gotta remind you guys for those who missed out last quarter, DELL went up well over 15% with earnings. It went up the earnings prior too and the one before that. What's also great is that the cons are cheap due to lower strike prices. So I'm going to grab 12/1 77c @ 1.80. We just need the stock to go up ~4.6% to break even here. Be mindful of the bid/ask spread tho, since this is a lower-volume contract. 75 and 76c boasts higher volume, but are a bit more expensive. To make things even cheaper, you can consider a put spread. Regardless, just like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. Next week, we have NIO, AI, and CHWY.

Wall Street expect them to report earnings per share of $1.08. Revenue of $1.12 billion, a slight increase of over the prior year quarter when the company reported $1.10 billion.\\n\\nZoom’s forecast for the January 2024 fiscal year calls for revenue of between $4.485 billion and $4.495 billion, up 2%, with adjusted profits of $4.63 to $4.67 a share. Consensus estimates call for revenue of $4.492 billion and earnings of $4.68 a share.\\n\\nWith the coronavirus emergency over, the company\\'s share price has been on a rollercoaster, lads. We\\'re talking cutthroat competition and growth hitting the brakes. But here\\'s the kicker: Zoom\\'s gotta level up in the corporate jungle if it wants to keep its revenue game strong. The company has been seeking to grow by moving beyond its flagship web meeting service. It has added software for contact centers, webinars, chat, and email, plus new artificial intelligence (AI) tools, among other things.\\n\\nBut growth remains slow. The stock has retreated 5% so far this year, with the Nasdaq shooting up 36% amid buzz over generative AI technology. Today, Zoom is likely to post its sixth-straight quarter of single-digit revenue growth.\\n\\nBut, on the plus side: Zoom Video has about $6 billion in cash on its balance sheet, they\\'re sitting on a treasure chest boys, and with this we should expect more acquisitions. In a research note previewing the quarter, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall, dropped some knowledge in a research note: the stock isn’t likely to move much until investors feel more confident about the company’s “online” business, the smaller customers who flocked to the platform during the pandemic. Marshall\\'s playing it chill with an Equal Weight on Zoom.\\n\\nAnother key question, Marshall mentioned, is when some of Zoom’s fresh toys might spur a reacceleration in the company’s enterprise business. And she also wonders when Zoom might use its strong balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions. As mentioned earlier, Zoom has $6 billion in cash and short-term investments, equal to about 31% of its market capitalization.\\n\\n**Important Factors**\\n\\nZoom’s fiscal third-quarter performance is likely to have gained from steady demand for products like Zoom Video Webinars, Zoom Rooms and Zoom Phones. An expanding portfolio of solutions is expected to have aided customer growth in this soon-reported quarter.\\n\\nThe company’s AI related advancements and partnerships in the fiscal third quarter are noteworthy. Zoom adopts a federated approach to AI, utilizing its own exclusive large-language AI models as well as models from renowned AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic.\\n\\nIn the to-be-reported quarter, ZM threw down its generative AI digital assistant into the mix. Rather than increase revenue, Zoom Video expects AI tools to retain customers. At its annual Zoomtopia user conference in early October, the company said it will not charge customers for use of its AI Companion. That\\'s right. They dished it out FREE for the Zoomers with paid accounts. Talk about a power move! This is totally expected to be a key growth driver. Its capabilities include meeting/chat summaries and smart recordings.\\n\\nIn this conference, the company announced new platform innovations that leverage robust AI capabilities aimed at simplifying the workday by providing efficient communication and collaboration tools.\\n\\nZoom Video is racing to build more artificial intelligence tools into its business communications platform. Zoom Video recently backed off from a change in its terms of service for platform users that would have enabled it to gather data to train AI models.\\n\\nSet for release in 2024, Docs is an AI-powered workspace that can be used for documentation, project tracking and management tasks.\\n\\nMeanwhile, recently told its employees to report to its offices on a more regular basis. Amid Covid-19 emergency, demand for Zoom videoconferencing software surged as businesses told employees to work from home.\\n\\nAlso, Zoom morphed into a social phenomenon as making video calls became routine for consumers to keep in touch with family and friends. Remote learning and needs in telemedicine also boosted demand for Zoom Video\\'s cloud-based services.\\n\\nThe availability of Zoom Clips, which allows users to easily record, edit and share high-fidelity short-form video messages, both internally and externally, is likely to have aided enterprise customer growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The company also announced the launch of Notes, a fresh workspace designed for creating and collaborating both before, during and after meetings.\\n\\nZoom Video aims to integrate AI into more products. At the Enterprise Connect conference in March, Zoom Video announced the expansion of a workplace collaboration platform. Called Zoom IQ, it summarizes chat threads, organizes ideas, drafts content for chats, emails, and whiteboard sessions and creates meeting agendas.\\n\\nIn May, Zoom announced an investment in AI startup Anthropic to support research roadmaps. Anthropic\\'s AI model will be integrated into Zoom\\'s Contact Center platform.\\n\\nZoom Video in July rolled out Zoom Workforce Management, which improves agent productivity by automating/optimizing agent work shifts and monitoring agent performance.\\n\\nThe consensus estimate for enterprise customers in the fiscal third quarter is currently pegged at 221,336.\\n\\nOne key to Zoom\\'s success has been a \"freemium\" business model. Zoom\\'s basic video-calling package is free. They put a limit on the number of participants in a group call and the length of meetings. Zoom software gets high ratings for ease of use and simplicity following earlier video services that provided jerky images and out-of-sync audio. The company’s freemium business model helps it win customers rapidly, whom it can later convert into paying customers. In the fiscal second quarter, customers contributing more than $100,000 in revenues in the trailing 12 months grew 17.8% to 3,672.  \\n\\nThese customers accounted for 29% of revenues, up from 26% in the year-ago quarter. The momentum is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, the number most likely well above 3,700 now. \\n\\nA \"Zoom Meeting\" refers to a videoconferencing session hosted on its cloud infrastructure. Paid Zoom business plans cost $15 or $20 per employee and require minimums of 10 or 50 seats.\\n\\nZoom Phone, a cloud-calling product rolled out in 2019, lets customers set up group internet phone calls without video. The Zoom Phone replaces traditional business PBX phone systems.\\n\\n\"Zoom reached 5.5 million paid phone seats at the end of 2023, up over 100% year-over-year,\" said Baird\\'s Power. \"The company expects that to become a 10% revenue segment early this year and perhaps as high as 25% in the future.\"\\n\\nHowever, the company has been facing significant competition from the likes of Cisco, Microsoft and Google Meet. This might have led to a loss in small and medium-sized business customers, which is likely to have hurt top-line growth.\\n\\nBut let\\'s talk competition, specifically with Microsoft. Sales growth slowed for the ninth-straight quarter as the company adjusts to slower product demand in the post-coronavirus emergency era. See, I\\'m left wondering when decelerating sales will hit a bottom.\\n\\nZoom\\'s cloud-based software sets up video calls, with chat tools available. Also, customers can easily share content. Microsoft and its Teams communications tools are pretty much offering the same and are Zoom\\'s major rival in the business market. Microsoft is upgrading its products with technology from startup OpenAI.\\n\\nThe company in early March said company President Greg Tomb, a former cloud computing executive at Alphabet\\'s Google, will leave. They also mentioned in Feb. 7 that they will cut 1,300 jobs, or about 15% of its workforce.\\n\\nAs the coronavirus crisis eases, retaining small businesses as well as corporate accounts will be one key to Zoom\\'s success. For customers with one to 10 employees, renewals are expected to slow as the economy reopens and shelter-in-place orders lift. There\\'s expected to be less turnover of larger customers.\\n\\nIn the business market, Zoom rivals include RingCentral (RNG), Cisco Systems, Google and others. Growth in annual recurring revenue for business customers with contracts topping $100,000 is one metric to monitor.\\n\\nIn July 2021, Zoom Video and Five9 (FIVN), which automates call center services, announced a deal to merge. The all-stock deal was originally valued at $14.7 billion. But the companies terminated the agreement on Sept. 30.\\n\\nZoom Video aims to be a player in the contact center market with its own products and services.\\n\\n**What to do for earnings?**\\n\\nOver the last 2 years, the shares averaged a move of 7.4% with earnings, regardless of direction.

Historically, Apple has only done that when they smell trouble:\\n\\n1. iPhone 5c was released in Sep2013\\n   1. AAPL dropped from \\\\~$26 to a low of \\\\~$15 from Sept2012 to July2013\\n   2.

QQQ was at \\\\~$114 at Jul2015, and did not exceed that consistently until Jul2016\\n3. iPhone SE2 was released right at the start of the pandemic, and the stock would\\'ve seen action similar to above had PapaPowell\\'sPrinter and his trusty iPad hadn\\'t snipped our currency with his printer ala Nero.\\n4. iPhone SE3 released in Mar2022, right when the post-printer correction was beginning to happen.\\n   1. AAPL dropped from \\\\~$182 from Jan2022, and did not exceed that until Jun2023.\\n   2. QQQ was at ATH in Jan2022, and was at post-pandemic low by Jan2023.\\n\\nApple is now doing iPhone SE4, new entry-level MB, new budget airpods all in 2024. I have no idea what breakfast Apple\\'s economists eat, but if Apple\\'s product rumors are any indication, we will be in more economic pain in the months to come.\\n\\n# My Guess For the Future\\n\\n*Side note: S&P500 does not have +6% weeks during real bull markets.

Only Two Surgical Robots approved by the FDA. Intuitive Surgical / $ISRG enjoyed a literal monopoly for over two decades and just two years before pandemic worldwide pause, a second ever contender was FDA approved. Now it\\'s post pandemic and it\\'s on like Donkey Kong.\\n\\nIntuitive and another one that is super low market cap, wsb bot won\\'t let me post name without deleting my post, due to it\\'s market cap. But it\\'s interesting to note, that despite it\\'s small market cap, it is completely DEBT FREE, and has powerful investors / board seat members, like Andrea Biffi, from SOFAR, an Italian pharma heavy weight, now MA\\'d(Merger Aquisitioned) by an even larger Pharma: Alfasigma, THE LARGEST Pharmaceutical company in Italy. So I wont name it. But I believe this small Market Cap contender will eventually cause ISRG to tumble and thus making ISRG a juicy short within the next year. It\\'s close to 300 bucks right now. So I\\'m buying puts on ISRG.\\n\\nIntuitive has super crappy technology vs recently FDA approved competitor. Competitor of Intuitive is less expensive. And has Re usable tools. Haptic Feedback for Surgeon. Eyetracking Camera. Google Cloud Healthcare AI and Nvidia partnership.\\n\\n1. More on Google Health Care AI Cloud Colab, Competitor has had a formal collab since February of this year: Note what Ashima Gupta Global Director of Healthcare For Google AI Cloud said back then:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dipy098l2atb1.png?width=1582&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ceb8cc19072ffb131bdf3dc9bdbb578598fb2b2\\n\\n2. Note what Director Said in Today\\'s (10-9-23) Press Release to CNBC :\\n\\n“These are the workflows that the physicians and nurses live by day in and day out. You can’t be adding friction to it,” Gupta told CNBC in an interview. “We are very cautious of that — that we are respecting the surface they use, that the workflow doesn’t change, but yet they get the power of this technology.” Link to today\\'s press release: where quote is from:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/09/google-announces-new-generative-ai-search-capabilities-for-doctors-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/09/google-announces-new-generative-ai-search-capabilities-for-doctors-.html)\\n\\nOther press release links that have GOOGL up today:\\n\\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hackensack-meridian-healths-cloud-and-data-modernization-with-google-cloud-enhances-patient-care-and-drives-innovation-301950222.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hackensack-meridian-healths-cloud-and-data-modernization-with-google-cloud-enhances-patient-care-and-drives-innovation-301950222.html)\\n\\n[https://www.infoworld.com/article/3708295/google-vertex-ai-search-updated-with-healthcare-and-life-sciences-capabilities.html](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3708295/google-vertex-ai-search-updated-with-healthcare-and-life-sciences-capabilities.html)\\n\\nNOTE: The Hospitals that are part of Googles First Release for beta release ARE THE SAME HOSPITALS WITH SENHANCES Surgical Robots. Mayo Clinic and Hackensak. Please note that the Competitor is working to UPLOAD live video and picures and all kinds of DATASETS for AI and AI search for HEALTHCARE FIELD. Competitor has Senhances worldwide with over 10,000 procedures and like Tesla\\'s record driver data and add it to Nueralink, the same happens with each Senhance that EACH SURGEON DRIVES, and Google / NVIDIA / Competitor are getting all Surgical Dataset gold. Very likely Google will pay Senhance creators a royalty to Competitor of ISRG. The fact is ISRG is flatfooted and will get rocked by this collab. When you see videos, links below, you will see Hackensack. And you will also see pic of Mayo Clinic Pediatrics anouncement a little over two weeks ago. See below for pics and links for further info/research/dd.\\n\\nIntuitive Surgical / $ISRG eye gauges the poor hospitals and surgeons by requiring them to buy new tools every 5th, 10th, 12th, or MAX: 18th surgical procedure-depending on the tool robotic tip.  Yes you read that correct. EVERY 18th SURGICAL PROCEDURE. The bulk of their revenues comes from this obvious and  unsustainable eye gauging. Vs Competitor, whose tools are able to be re used indefinitely for life of tool. One Surgical Robot Surgeon mentioned they had been using the same tools from the Competitor for over 3 years!!Please google-I have links below-but you can google for yourselves also if you like:  Carlos Mendoza Herrera Master Surgeon from Cedar Sinai in Chicago. Also google = Amit Travedi , Hackensack Medical Hospital, Carlos Mendoza Herrera / Sinai Chicago, links below.\\n\\nNotice picture=Also notice the open cockpit design of Competitor vs ISRG. ISRG surgical Robot Da  Vinci kills your peripheral view and forces you to hunch over, and you lose your clear line of sight of operating table and staff. Your head needs to go inside a hole in the machine.  Then you need to stare through two more holes. While on Senhance from Competitor, you keep a clear line of sight, sit comfortably upright and maintain a clear line of sight on operating table and staff. And stare a beautiful screen that\\'s in front of you.\\n\\nCompetitor to ISRG currently has a formal Google Healthcare Cloud Agreement since February. And another formal agreement with juggernaut Nvidia, anounced much more recently-see pics below.\\n\\nMayo Clinic recently added the Competitors Surgical robot over Da Vinci becuase of all the aformentioned PLUS ISRG DOES NOT HAVE 3mm ports. In other words, 3mm is the literal size the robotic arms can cut to enter the thoracic cavity in order to operate. And so after surgical procedure, you don\\'t have a foot long gaping wound stitched from which to heal from, but literally a 3mm cut. maybe like three 3mm cuts from which to heal from. An Inch is 25mm. To give you an idea of how small that is and how fast post operative healing can be especially for tiny infants that are a month old that can\\'t handle 8mm or 12mm cuts the smallest ISRG has.\\n\\nISRG will take years to get FDA approval for a complete refresh to compete with an open cockpit design where the surgeon is upright looking at a screen. Also ISRG will take years to get 3mm approved and field pre clinically tested. Things the competitor ALREADY HAS FDA APPROVED AND IN THE MARKET AS THE MAYO CLINIC RECENTLY SHOWED. ISRG in their monopolistic comfort rested on it\\'s laurels technology never bothered or cared to refresh their tech and upgrade, because they were the only game in town and never had to for over two decades so hospitals and doctors had to deal with what they ( $ISRG) gave them. Now they\\'re caught flat footed.\\n\\n\\\\*A little deviation on what is Laparoscopy -and why Robotic Surgery is an evolution to that:\\n\\nSo the question I keep asking myself is WHY hasn\\'t ISRG come up with 3mm port and a better open cockpit design in 23 years of their monopoly? Because they\\'ve never really needed to improve their lower tier tech, because there literally was NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE THAN THEM. This led to massive abuse on their part, more on that below, lawsuits and unhappy Hospitals and medical centers.\\n\\nAll robotic surgery crux is a minimally invasive surgery from smaller wounds you can heal from. so your up and running faster, with less pain, and can return to work, family, your routine in a much shorter time span than from an open surgery that leaves a massive wound maybe a foot long, that cuts through muscle, tendons, perhaps bones. Please see video links below for more explanation on this. They are short videos, like 2-5 minutes long. Laparoscopy was the MANUAL way of minimally invasive surgery, meaning an endoscopic camera gets placed inside your body, through a small incision and two tiny arms that are controlled manually, obviously this is a challenging form of surgery, but under skilled surgeons, extremely successful. With robotic surgery you have the steady hand, tremor free, you\\'re able to sit down through out the process, and lessen the fatigue of hours long surgeries, ergo more successful, and safer surgeries, perhaps one after the other. Plus Software like no fly zones where the robot arm cannot extend and injure or maim a certain organ accidentally-something not avail with manual Laparascopy. Something ISRG does NOT have but Senhance does. See Lawsuits link below. Also measuring distances between organs, etc, can be done with software. VS inserting a phsyical sterilized ruler which was the way it was done before manually without the robotics-but still done with ISRG. Also articulated instruments inside the abdomen, add more dexterity with robotic surgical systems.  These are the advantages of Robotic Surgeriy over manual minimally invasive Laparoscopic surgeries. So robotic surgery is a level above manual laparascopy. Manaual Laparascopy was a level up from traditional open surgery.\\\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1imbfz7u9tb1.jpg?width=2254&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e5bd9cdb7b6baa35464216d31b101a3ffa99126\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xci95rxfu9tb1.jpg?width=2527&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4464f9f8789bc2122e3761c24946b6b14f21ff9d\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nnbxodau9tb1.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7e8e43a9e14ecaf2407a6c9a17162446e22cdef\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kpx4m6aju9tb1.jpg?width=2205&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e273bb0eb0b38ab8bb3c360ad9b7f0bcb77adc6\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9goamytpu9tb1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2a885341ead73d490af5307a68b79d86011d7b1a\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ll0j2zfsu9tb1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=7652bc0b1541771be87a2020bef95d65eb68dda7\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nuhxkrj85atb1.jpg?width=1044&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4be72bc25d696747823e2aa8708942b7666dd202\\n\\nISRG tries to scrub their lawsuits on the internet but no die.

And letting you guys know about it. It\\'s a big thick juicy short, over 200 hundred bucks, close to 300 bucks a share. And short puts are relatively inexpensive right now. Not too inexpensive but still inexpensive in my book, very manageable price. My view is it took Tesla 17 years to become profitable in a multi competitor arena, there were several cars people could choose from. Here? there\\'s ONLY TWO in the ENTIRE VAST MARKET of Surgeries, which all will be moving in some way shape or form to digitized, robotics. So either ISRG stops resting on it\\'s monopolistic laurels or gets taken to the barn out back and shot, like Ford, GM, Chrysler/Stellantis has, by Tesla. Another fun fact: Toyota: It took them 26 years to become profitable. My point, This is LITERALLY a two man market. Competitor and ISRG. And one is lagging with tech and customer satisfaction and treatment, while the other is excelling.\\n\\nI\\'ll be editing the post as time goes by, with any further news or updates.

July and August have been very very interesting. Coming into this year 2023 everyone was all on board with “Hard landing” but then after seeing the tech AI rally and YTD returns everyone became convinced of “Soft landing” up until July but now recently there has been a shift, everyone is back on “No landing” scenario as the Atlanta Fed started showing strong Gdp growth in Q3. People are now convinced that yields will continue going higher as the government will keep on spending money like drunken sailors even in the face of rising deficits. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvrch7a2ynnb1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=40f7892fc0087a1e188069fe1f29d83669c09ffc\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo now let’s talk about these recent months. In the first month of June, we had Central Banks across the globe i.e. ECB and BOE taking a hawkish stance in their fight against inflation whereas our Fed chickened out in June Fomc due to treasury refill. BOJ on the other hand was pretty chill in the June meeting. But in July we had something opposite. Fed hiked rates again and was comparatively hawkish than the ECB which sounded more dovish due to some risk Lagarde was seeing even after hiking 25bps. BOJ flipped and tweaked their YCC policy which no one thought they would do at the July meeting whereas BOE on Aug 3 decided to step down the pace of hikes from 50 bps in June to now 25bps. In the Cintra meeting, Powell thought two more hikes ( one done, one left )  may be appropriate while Ueda-san was making jokes. Then we had the Super Bowl of Fomc called Jackson Hole in the fourth week of August. This was covered in depth in our last letter. Do check that out. So overall we have the US leading at 5.50% (last hike July), the UK at 5.25% (last hike Aug) and the EU at 4.25%. (last hike July) BOJ hasn\\'t even stopped buying bonds yet but they are changing the target for the 10-year JGB\\'s.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[6 month past returns](https://preview.redd.it/bhvda6omwnnb1.png?width=1803&format=png&auto=webp&s=02cfeda978cfebe7d1f4bf9ac278c81824d2f8dc)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Since S&P 500 topped at $4600](https://preview.redd.it/ssmdogx6xnnb1.png?width=1799&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5694ed84425216708bcd4d3c1d1014c01e8615)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLet\\'s talk about markets. S&P500 and Nasdaq were looking pretty strong till July Opex due to strong disinflation down to 3%. But then after consolidating for a while they started showing some early signs of weakness in August but now have started recovering from late August. DJI and Russell 2000 were outperforming our main index in this consolidation but then they too started to show some signs of weakness like our main index and now have started to recover except Rusell which is still trading at August lows. So now let\\'s see what happens in \"Witching Week\". As for the Bond market initially, it was pretty boring but after Long end issuance, BoJ tweak, Fitch downgrade, USA strong GDP by Atlanta Fed, China selling to defend the peg, and ofc Ackman’s tweet things are looking much more interesting here even more than the stock market. But to everyone\\'s surprise both MOVE and VIX are pretty much dead. Oil has started to pick up in the past month due to supply constraints while Gold is down because Dxy is still so strong and that strength is clearly visible against Yen and Yuan where policy is still easing.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9r3phcqqvnnb1.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aa990203d0a29ea5edaec971f55294dce3ce4e3\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow let\\'s talk about social media. Everyone on Fintwit recently is bearish. No one wants to calculate anything and are hoping sept will just crash markets automatically. If it doesn\\'t they will flip it to October. People are talking about how Nvidia is a fraud and that the Government is manipulating data. Some are claiming Oil is going $300 and will bring recession, some say fiscal deficits will only grow higher and then some say inflation is headed for double digits by 2025 etc etc. \\n\\nInstagram was blowing up like crazy in the July-Aug season. Taylor Swift, Beyonce and Barbenheimer mania were taking over the internet. People went on a spending spree this season all around the globe. \\n\\nI don\\'t use tik tok so sorry about that. As for Yt, Meet Kevin is all bullish and believes in nike swoosh recovery. Jeff Snyder is all in on deflation trade since dec 2021. Maybe he will get one next year who knows. Lyn Alden released her book do check that out. Luke has been talking about higher Oil prices due to US shale production rolling over. Lyn and Luke both believe that higher rates are inflationary.  Lets see if that turns out to be true or not. Maverick is waiting for Stagflation and people in the comment section have started calling him perma bear. C\\'mon guys don\\'t be so mean.  All in Pod is firing all cylinders and i never miss their show except the Presidential candidates one. JCal is still the world’s best moderator, at least in the finance world. I haven\\'t watched a lot of Blockworks macro recently because these past 3 months I have been busy reviewing tv shows, movies and anime. Finally, I watched “Vikings” after so long and then later “Witcher” and that K-drama “It\\'s Okay to not be okay” and many other countless movies (Dredd etc.) and anime. Rest all others picks their topics and make high production videos. And some few roast others people. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow let\\'s head to some important points to know about the main driver of the stock market rally.\\n\\nNo 1: It’s those 7 stocks that drove the index higher by trading at higher multiples due to AI mania. So the PE ratio of SPX skyrocketed from 16x to 20.48 this year. An interesting thing to note is the SPX traded at 22x fwd earnings when rates were basically at 0%. Now some may wonder why it traded only 22x why not 30x like Nasdaq. Well, its coz of Equity risk premia ranging b/w 350-250 bps and 10-year yields at 1-1.5%.Now what has happened is 10yr bond yields are trading high around 4% range while equity risk premia has gone down to below 100 bps. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Current Erp = 65bps using 10yr bond yields at 4.30&#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/0ggcnjdsrnnb1.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=b380566b5a58cd67e96ef45fa1adaa29da24b818)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNo 2 : x% of the strength in the stock market in recent months came from the Fed\\'s liquidity injection in March, and y% came from people buying or covering their shorts. No matter how many times the market goes down, there seems to be a relentless buying pressure beneath that keeps it from falling. This pressure was likely caused by investors trying to chase a rally after being caught on the opposite side of the trade in the first half of 2023. However, the Fed\\'s liquidity injections have since declined, and more people have started to believe in the \"soft landing\" narrative, which is the idea that inflation can be brought back to 2% by the end of the year without an increase in unemployment or a decline in GDP growth. This narrative is imo is false, but it is causing some investors to become complacent and less willing to sell. As we move forward, I would advise investors to stay patient and wait for a better entry point. There are still some attractive opportunities in the bond market, and I would also recommend keeping an eye on emerging markets, which could offer some good value.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Recap :**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n [Wall Street Newsletter S03E01: Complacency or Disbelief? : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1471rcz/wall_street_newsletter_s03e01_complacency_or/) \\n\\nSo in our first post this season we talked about how Ueda-san will make changes to YCC policy by surprise which he did. The reason was already discussed by Uchida-san. Let’s not delve into that jungle. We also talked about how stock market will make a top in July coz < 3.1% inflation will make people jaw drop. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5ewsa78rnnb1.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=8aed1a159ac160a98e223036174284f3a96cc7c2\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnd at the end we also discussed this butterfly effect theory from a research paper where the United Kingdom, Canada and several other countries are in trouble because their rates are not fixed at all. Yes friends that guy we discussed yah he is my friend from England. So basically nothing happens to USA and everything happens to the rest part of the world. This will all make DXY go stronger as other countries go into recession one by one. So please don\\'t blindly believe people who say America is about to fall. I mean if America falls rest of the world will go down first just like Asian financial crisis before the Dotcom crash of 2000.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[The Royal Bank CEO agrees with this theory but the guy doesnt know its gonna be \\\\\\\\\"Hard landing\\\\\\\\\" for Canada.](https://preview.redd.it/rl0cjvorqnnb1.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dcb9a376bf8a53691c4336f79b948cf61605f1d)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38jh7yqgynnb1.png?width=2154&format=png&auto=webp&s=04c26e43d73ce231d835a831213c76b0c7d24a37\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Experiment: Understanding Market forces using technicals, Liquidity, Presidential cycle and bond cycle.**\\n\\nIn this experiment what we are going to do is we are gonna understand these 4 concepts one by one and then at the we will summarize all that we learned and come up with results and conclusions.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Bond cycle :** \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m46z0430snnb1.png?width=1850&format=png&auto=webp&s=104d39ae7c18b3dabfcc3f16188ac4ebde9cbd53\\n\\n \\n\\nJust like businesses in America have 8-10 yr cycles similarly bonds have a long, intermediate and short cycle they go through. So basically this chart with price candle represent 10yr bond yields which has been falling since 1980. But now if you add a 200dMA (on your screen) to this 10yr bond yields chart you will see that we no longer belong to this deflationary world we had in last 40yrs. But what does this actually mean ? It means the world has changed and we are entering a period of deglobalization where the the world will become more multi polar and we keep having these shortages that will cause inflation spikes. So forget about deflation guys. Deflation is no longer the risk in an inflationary world. The risk is more inflation just like the deflation was the risk in a deflationary world. The rules of the game have changed and it will definitely take some time for people to really understand this. So this decade imo will just play out like a combination of 1940-50 and 1970-80 decade where inflation will come back. No one knows when but i can guarantee you it will. Fed will use this inflation as an opportunity to bring down the debt/gdp ratio slowly for next 40yrs. Govt will also have a big role to play this decade. There will be a financial repression no doubt about it. Bond holders will lose money for the next 40yrs while stockholders will enjoy the benefit of nominal earnings but it will take some time. First 10yrs are usually sideways so let’s see what happens. As you all know that i have been calling for \"Stagflation - High unemployment\" since last yr but do you guys know Black Rock has finally come up with a word to explain this thesis it\\'s called “Full employment Stagnation”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs for inverted yield curve and steepener, well guys you see this theory is still kinda in progress. I believe that if Bull steepener was the risk in deflationary period then Bear steepener should be the risk in an inflationary period. Idk how to explain this stuff as there is no data backing but idk it\\'s just my gut feeling. Think about it if we have a bull steepener doesn\\'t it mean the Fed has to cut rates as the inflation fight is over. Markets would love this and if we ever go into deflation Fed has the luxury to always print just like they did in 2020,2023 so the market will not care. C\\'mon guys those chickens at Fed showed their hands. One hint of Powell printing and the market will go up and the Fed wouldn\\'t actually have to print. It\\'s kinda what Hank Paulson suggested back in 2008. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Presidential cycle :**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yolx2b/wall\\\\_street\\\\_newsletter\\\\_s02e04\\\\_the\\\\_real\\\\_truth/?utm\\\\_source=share&utm\\\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yolx2b/wall_street_newsletter_s02e04_the_real_truth/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\\n\\nSometimes I kinda hate myself that I gave bulls an analysis so powerful going back to 125 yrs that they could use it against bears in future and guess what, they did. The gods were in their favor. xD\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lt42jtklsnnb1.png?width=1437&format=png&auto=webp&s=c42f04463475c4d5e27deda47376fd3014006c8a\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFor those who don\\'t know but this post is from Oct-Nov the one bull case i spotted. It\\'s pretty simple to understand. We all know the presidential cycle is of 4yrs. So the first term President always tries to get a 2nd term so what he does is he causes the stock market to go higher right before the election yr i.e a third year of the Presidential cycle in the hope that his party would win the election. So Biden alongside the Treasury and Fed created this magic of “Not QEin BTFP”, “QT on front and QE on back”, “Not YCC” , “Treasury special programs”, “SPR drain to bring Oil down in CPI”, “Delaying student debt”  and much more to pump the stock market. On one hand they say they are tightening while their actions suggests they are adding liq to the system to buy time at least they were until recently when collateral started misbehaving when the long end started to move up higher.  So now guys, let\\'s use the Presidential cycle \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uush4zwssnnb1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c85ad3936cb975e971f5f5d35c4072669f3d0d1\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo the way to approach this is to construct a scenario using the last presidential cycle before recession as markets and people can act on recency bias. So when you do the analysis here’s what you would come with.\\n\\n\\\\-> Markets will top out in January 2023 Opex just like last inflationary times of 1973-74 resulting in a blowoff top. This is based on general assumption by looking at the above charts.\\n\\n\\\\-> Markets will top out in October 2023 or already have. This is based on the last Presidential cycle.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Market forces :** \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo in our last  newsletter we understood the correlation b/w various forces in fx, bonds and stock mkt but in this letter we will discuss the individual strength of those forces and how they are looking at various time frames. So for people who are looking forward to causing a market crash, always remember we need all the market forces to work in unidirectional ways. If the forces aren’t aligned together nothing substantial will happen. But aligning forces is not the only thing that matters.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bejb05a2ynnb1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=405ff63e4758c2be761c2171086d15c069ea7716\\n\\nThe liquidity function also needs to work in our favor otherwise no such market event is ever gonna happen. And then basically you combine all of this with the presidential cycle. As for bond cycles, look guys don\\'t rely on anything you learned in the past 40 yrs. There is a risk out there that Bond cycles have changed so I would request everyone to keep an open mind and not commit to a single framework. Try to analyze things from both sides of the coin i.e. inflationary or deflationary. So in summary f(presidential + mkt forces + liq ) for both inflationary and deflationary/disinflationary way is the way to go. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOkay so without any further delay let’s get started with technicals. \\n\\nStep 1 : Forex Markets\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cxnbfpeytnnb1.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=921c5f2ce983658eb5c41cf8d8e9c39edcb92d69\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**EUR-USD :**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEverybody is obsessed about the Euro-dollar system, how offshore banks and money dealers create dollars out of thin air and lend to whomever needs cash without Fed reserve requirements. This Eurodollar system has nothing to do with the Eur-usd currency pair which is represented in the above chart. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs you can see the above charts are 1yr and 6m charts basically to guide you where the pair is headed. You don\\'t need to look at technicals in depth here, just a basic price action and volume analysis will do. So as you can see on the left the Eur-Usd trades in a parabola. It made its ATH in yr 2008 and then it went down with stochastic RSI till yr 2016-17. It then went up for a while but then something was stopping it from going higher so it went down but then rose again only to get rejected again. So last year it went way down to test the parabola base but then closed the yr very strongly to not break the 2016-17 yearly close. So this year its trying to figure out what it should do just like i am. If it closes the yr badly and breaks that 2016-17 yr close bad things will happen next year. If it manages to give a green candle things may go right next yr. If it closed red but didn\\'t break support and form some kind of doji candle god knows what it will do.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow let\\'s move to 6 months to give a better outlook of what\\'s gonna happen since yearly didn\\'t help much. The only difference here in this chart is that we have that black rectangle bar composed of two lines. Upper one is touching the candle closes while the below one is touching the wicks. So as you can see the Eur-usd price action is better understood in this graph. It has broken a very important wedge and is getting rejected as a 2H 2023 candle. This basically is typical price action when a chart pattern breaks a wedge it doesn\\'t immediately fall, it backtests it from below and then the main test happens. So let\\'s say this candle which closes on Dec engulfed the one or both green candles then it looks trouble for Europe. And if am wrong and there is no parabola just a wedge then Eur Usd is going 0.85 ride if not 0.60-0.62. Yah kinda crazy right. But now some people will say bro look at stochastic Rsi its gonna cross and we move up. I would say yeah it looks promising but then the decreasing volume aint helping you. Also we have not really tested the RSI support. So imo the most likely scenario is Eur-usd going down.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Three months ( i.e. 3M )  Time Frame Analysis :** \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5bvep7mztnnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e7347dbb6856ab04bdf4ce1a1148ae8d28f090a\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* I am sorry Euro bros&sis but the price action here again confirms that there is some sort of rejection Eur-usd is facing.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Many people don\\'t know but Eur-usd Oct 1998 3m candle dictated the play for the Dotcom bubble to burst which caused Dxy 120+ making all tech companies look stupid. Same thing is happening again but far more sinister. That time we had only (21ema, 50ma) 3m cross. This time my friends we have (50ma,100ma) 3m cross. Someone has to stop this otherwise we all are fucked.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Stochastic RSI is about to cross in 3 months which again does not look good. Normal RSI is also getting rejected but tbh i am making this up.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* As for volume, let\\'s look at prev action first. 2013-15 : volume up, price down = okay, 2019 : volume down, price down = not okay. Hence we got move up but then the move up was on decreasing vol meaning it has to go max at double top. And that\\'s why we got move down by increasing volume. Someone might now say \"Bro anybody can read past behavior\" Dude what are you talking? We covered it here on WS:s01e11. So now guys it\\'s happening again. Decreasing vol, price up = fake move. Meaning Eur-usd will go down. But will it go straight down to 0.85 or dance it way through constructing two tops. Do i look like i have crystal ball? Now some of you folks be like “No son you tell me now pick one”. Fine okay rejection at wedge should be impulse down at 0.85. After that god knows.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sbmprzg0unnb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bb627779d03322cb59843fdb9b234d986b703eb\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Monthly Time Frame Analysis :**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Now we draw pretty pictures with the price, date and pattern we are targeting. It’s becoming more and more clear now why July 2023 month was the peak for Eur-usd bull traders. This pattern is a sigh of relief that the world will not come to an end but rather it will be somewhere in 2030-40 when RHS will put an impulse down to 0.60 from 1.40-1.50. So nothing to worry much Euro guys. We can handle a 0.85 price target with the window closing in July 2025. Now some ppl will be like “Fuck you, i aint waiting that long” Guys this is forex. Patience is the name of the game. But if you guys are loaded please make it your sh9tcoin. I too want things to happen fast but the fastest we are gonna get is 0.85 by July 2024. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Talking about moving averages well there ain\\'t much happening as 50 month MA is already below 100 month MA. Eur-usd is fighting for its life with 21 ema. 200 monthly is nicely curving along and will reject any stupid rallies if some CB’s tries to be oversmart.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Stochastic RSI monthly again looks like a carbon copy of 1998. So this tells us that the target window should be 2025. Sorry guys it is what it is. Same goes for Macd as well. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* As for volume monthly indicates quite beautifully that this recent move up was on decreasing vol so it must be fake. And now as we are getting this move down volume is creeping up suggesting yah we are gonna fall.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Although I didn\\'t draw the Elliot wave, one can tell that bears will talk about the Wave 5 while Eurusd bulls will argue that the 5th wave has already happened and we should move along. I personally will side with bears coz the price never just picks off. It needs good support and sideways churn to really get going and we haven\\'t seen anything like 2001 yet.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Result : I can confidently say with 99% certainty that  Eur-usd is going down to 0.85 by July 2025. Madame Lagarde has a big task on her hands. Raise more rates and cause recession, bring inflation down and do the right thing or let it leave high enough for a death by thousand cuts. I think she is gonna choose latter coz of European work culture but regardless consumer spending will go down. And this creates the possibility of interest rate differential and an open invitation to bears to short the currency. But guys seriously lagarde has done a great job until now. I thought this woman was batsh9t crazy but I think her experimental tools are working. One thing to keep in back of mind is if ECB changes policy and makes floating rate debt fixed then it becomes complicated and traders have to think if Euro and US debt is fixed then whose inflation will rebound higher and thereby CB\\'s needing to do more.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTo be continued...\\n\\n(Sorry guys the reason i couldn\\'t finish was i got too drunk.

Prior to this the SPAC\\'s future price ratios were based on \\\\~200M shares post merger\\n\\nWith 1.3B in cash to balance sheet, this meant for a **Price/Book ratio of 6.9 (industry average)** the share price was set to roughly **$45 a share.** which I don\\'t think was a coincidence for the former 45th president.

With retail nearly unaffected in ownership % and the final share count being around 200M.\\n\\nAt the time the PIPE was negotiated - this represented more likely that they would receive a smaller stake in the company but with the stock trading on the open market for a higher price.\\n\\nSince the stock price has suffered, it\\'s likely the renegotiation will involve new % ranges varied on different performance criteria - but the renegotiation will likely still be $1B in cash for roughly \\\\~1/3rd of the company.\\n\\nShould the PIPE not be exactly like this or fail entirely (don\\'t think so) the bull play would still be strong but the uphill battle against the industry would be a little harder with less capital and the stock would need to trade more on forward looking fundamentals and a float squeeze\\n\\nThe PIPE deal, when closed, should provide massive positive catalyst and an even bigger catalyst when the funding is received on the merger.\\n\\n# Understanding the future fundamentals\\n\\nBelow you can see the key industry competitors sorted by largest company size (market cap)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vmbk73mqo5ib1.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=0efa340c72401e0d469de4749ce631c3d10ceeea\\n\\nCompanies like Facebook have about 3 billion monthly active users (MAU) or Netflix has around 238M monthly subscribers.\\n\\nTo get a sense of what the future revenues of TMTG would like we need to understand what their monetization with Truthsocial and TMTG+ would look like\\n\\nHere\\'s the same list sorted by most revenue per user\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzxn3tkro5ib1.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e129f6202029f2c3ad11e4a872cd858480a0ed8\\n\\nFacebook has the highest revenue of any social media company (around $39 per user per year) because of their targeted ads being able to reach so many global users with large pools of every demographic (plus other over reaching data issues congress has roasted them for)\\n\\nOther companies like Tik Tok and Twitter are quite a bit lower around $10 per user a year.\\n\\nI believe TS would be around $6 a year in revenue per users eventually getting up to $20.

Demographic Disaster: China\\'s \"one-child policy\" fallout is STILL haunting them like a ghost in an empty casino. With a population set to plummet, the workforce will inevitably shrink, affecting productivity and consumption. The Tik-Tok-farmed Gen Z ain’t going to save the day, and fewer hands on deck would irreparably damage their GDP.\\n\\n2. Inflated Census Data: China\\'s knack for “creative accounting” isn\\'t limited to their balance sheets. Suspicion has long surrounded the accuracy of their already underwhelming census data. If their population figures are as trustworthy as a lottery scratcher from a shady convenience store, their economic indicators might be equally questionable. A financial house of cards, perhaps?\\n\\n3. The Red Gerontocracy: The Politburo ain\\'t getting any younger, and neither is their grip on power. As geriatric leaders struggle with technology (beyond censoring the web), a generational disconnect will further hinder policy agility. A rapidly changing world needs swift decision-making, not political debates over who can work the photocopier. Xi is going down with the ship, the question is how loyal will the over 90% Han Chinese population be to their failed leader?\\n\\n4. Overreliance on Exports: China\\'s economy is a global hentai octopus, its tentacles stretching deep *moan* into every corner of the Earth. But what happens when the world stops buying? With trade tensions and diversification efforts continually rising, China\\'s export-heavy model might be as outdated as Usher.\\n\\n5. Housing Bubble: China\\'s obsession with ghost cities would make Scooby-Doo proud. A housing bubble looms larger than a parade float, with unoccupied urban landscapes begging for tenants. When the music stops, will there be enough chairs for China\\'s real estate speculators?

On lobbying disclosures, \"Affiliated organizations\" for the New Federalism Fund are listed as Tilray (as **Privateer Holdings**), **PharmaCann** (as LivWell), and **Miracle Gro** (as The Scotts Company). These three will represent **Big Tech, Altria, and British Tobacco** in my conspiracy, respectively. With lots of overlap.\\n\\n**3/23/2017: ALTRIA -** The **New Federalism Fund** is officially launched. This is the earliest \"advocacy\" orginization that I think is in on the conspiracy. I\\'m guessing they worked the conspiracy out with Altria via Rafaniello and Associates.\\n\\n**4/12/2017: BRITISH TOBACCO -** **Miracle Gro** engages lobbyist **BGR Government Affairs**. This is the engagement that brings **Brady Cobb** into more prominence later. Brady Cobb and BGR are very connected. I think this is the New Federalism Fund (ALTRIA) via Miracle Gro making a connection with the most prominent sketchy cannabis operators in Florida. **Brady Cobb (and later Cresco Labs**) will be the **intermediary for Florida** (BRITISH TOBACCO), while **Miracle Gro** is the **intermediary for New York** (ALTRIA).\\n\\n**5/17/2017: ALTRIA** \\\\- **First version of SAFE Banking Act is introduced**. Per **Rob Kampia**, the \"advocacy\" group **Marijuana Policy Project** helped tobacco companies **adjust the language in exchange for donations**. He cites that the tobacco companies **want to own the industry**. Says it\\'s an obvious fit. He will be ousted from MPP not long after this. **Remember this for the end.**\\n\\n**7/15/2017: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **American Bankers Association** engages with lobbyist **Harbinger Strategies.**\\n\\n**7/20/2017: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **British Tobacco** acquires **John Boehner\\'s Reynolds American Tobacco**. Two months after SAFE is introduced, and 5 days after American Bankers Association registers with Harbringer, a deal is announced that **brings British Tobacco into the United States**. I don\\'t think this is a coincidence.\\n\\n**10/30/2017: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **Contellation Brands** makes first major investment in legal cannabis of **nearly $200M**. This sets off the industry and billions of dollars start getting tossed around. Sketchy deals are everywhere.\\n\\n**12/26/2017: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **Rob Kampia** is ousted at **Marijuana Policy Project**. He will immediately form a **\"for profit\" lobbying firm Marijuana Leadership Campaign**. They have been dormant ever since. They don\\'t register as lobbyists for years. **Remember this for the end.**\\n\\n**3/8/2018: ALTRIA** \\\\- Invests **$1.8 Billion into Cronos Group**. This company will later buy a large stake in **PharmaCann**, and currently has **PharmaCann exec as CEO**.\\n\\n**4/11/2018: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **John Boehner** joins board of directors of **Acreage Holdings**\\n\\n**4/20/2018: ALTRIA** \\\\- The **New Federalism Fund** merged with The **American Trade Association for Cannabis and Hemp** to form **The Cannabis Trade Federation**. The top board members are **PharmaCann** (LivWell), **Curaleaf**, and Native Roots (has **Privateer Holding**s connections). Other top members of interest include **Miracle Gro** and **Green Thumb.** I believe ATACH might connect the two groups at the moment, but I need to lock down that timeline.\\n\\n**7/25/2018: ALTRIA** \\\\- **Altria** engages w/ lobbyist **BRownstein Hyatt Farber Shreck**, who are currently with the C**annabis Trade Federation**. I believe this establishes **PharmaCann/Curaleaf/Privateer** are connected **New Federalism Fund via BHSF to Altria**. Cronos group will later take a large stake in PharmCann in 2021, further solidifying this group. Today, **Altria is still lobbying with BHSF for \"non-tobacco excise tax**\" per lobbying records.\\n\\n**8/3/2018: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- Per lawsuit filed by \"The 10 Campaign\" against **Boehner**. This is when **Acreage Holdings** first contacted lobbyists **The Liaison Group**.\\n\\n**8/15/18: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **Constellation Brands** invests additional **$4 Billion in Canopy Growth.**\\n\\n**9/1/2018: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **The Liaison Group** engages with **Acreage Holdings**. Note the overlap between first contact and actually registering, a major deal is made. I think that is important to see how they are trying to hide these connections.\\n\\n**11/14/2018: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **Liaison Group** engages with **California Cannabis Industry Association**. I think this is BRITISH TOBACCO setting up coordination with the groups. Pretty much **mostly Acreage and the CCIA pay Liaison Group**. They are a new, small lobbying firm. Not one you would expect to lobby for a group with John Boehner at the top.\\n\\n**12/24/18 ALTRIA** \\\\- **PharmaCann** agrees to be bought by **MedMen for $700M** (deal will fall apart a year later). This is a strong connection for **ALTRIA (PharmaCann) to Brady Cobb (via MedMen exec Serruya).**\\n\\n**NOTE - THE NEXT FOUR DATES ARE IMPORTANT 🌿**\\n\\n**2/8/2019: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **John Boehner** joins the board of **The National Cannabis Roundtable**.\\n\\n**3/6/2019: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **One day before SAFE** is re-introduced **Liaison Group** engages with **The National Cannabis Roundtable**. They are the lobbyists who are basically only paid by Boehner\\'s Roundtable and the California Cannabis Industry Association. The CCIA includes ALTRIA. I believe CCIA was playing the US Cannabis Council role at this point, but it\\'s harder to know.\\n\\n**3/7/2019 SAFE BANKING INTRODUCED IN HOUSE**. This is introduced **less than a month** after **Boehner** joins the top of **BRITISH TOBACCO\\'s** \"advocacy\" group, and a single day after they engage Liaison Group. Both tobacco companies are good to go, so the bill is introduced.\\n\\n**4/18/2019: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **Canopy Growth** acquires **Acreage Holdings**. Again, **British Tobacco** waits until right after SAFE is introduced to make a big move into US. Previously they acquired John Boehner\\'s tobacco company in 2017. This time, their company Acreage is absorbed into the largest operator in the world at the time.\\n\\n**7/17/19: ALTRIA** \\\\- **Curaleaf** announces Grassroots acquisition to become **largest cannabis company** in the world. BRITISH TOBACCO and ALTRIA teams are trading major acquisitions back and forth. Each building their team.\\n\\n**8/15/19: KOCH BROTHERS** \\\\- A new advocacy group, the **Global Alliance for Cannabis Commerce** is officially formed. **Randal Meyers** is on the initial lobbying disclosure. **Randal Meyers** is associated with **Koch and Rand Paul**. Between this group **intiially registering for lobbying, and officially launching**, Canopy Growth acquires Acreage Holdings (BRITISH TOBACCO). Another contact/major deal/actually register situations. We now have C**anopy leading BRITISH TOBACCO team**, while **Curaleaf is leading ALTRIA team**, both finalizing huge moves, and the **Koch Brothers getting into the \"advocacy\"** groups. It\\'s all coming together.\\n\\n**12/11/2019: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **Canopy Growth** invests in **DNA Genetics** who are founding members of the **Global Alliance for Cannabis Commerce**. This forms a strong connection between **Canopy Growth and Koch via Randal Meyers**\\' association w/ DNA Genetics (an \"associated company\" on his lobbying disclosures)\\n\\n**5/13/2020: BRITISH TOBACOO** \\\\- **Cresco** and **Trulieve** heads are put at **top positions at Boehner\\'s The National Cannabis Roundtable**. This solidifies my theory that British Tobacco has Florida as the keystone of their deal.\\n\\n**7/23/2020: ALTRIA** \\\\- The **Curaleaf** acquisition of Grassroots closes, making them largest cannabis company in the world.\\n\\n**11/12/2020: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **Verano Holdings** announces expansion through **Florida**. Not a coincedence this is soon after Cresco/Trulieve get on board with team BRITISH TOBACCO. Remember for later, as Verano will be associated strongly with **Cresco, the Kochs, and Chicago/Florida** markets.\\n\\n**12/15/2020: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **Cresco** engages with lobbyist **BGR Government Affairs**. This is the first direct link from **Brady Cobb to Cresco, and is important**. Remember BGR is associated to Cobb from way back.\\n\\n**12/16/2020: ALTRIA** \\\\- **Tilray announces Aphria** merger. **Brady Cobb goes way back with Aphria** management to their Liberty Health/SOL/Scythian days. I don\\'t think this is a coincedance this was announced **one day after Cobb becomes associated with my BRITISH TOBACCO group**.\\n\\n**12/20/2020: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **AYR Wellness** expands through **Florida** by purchasing **Liberty Health**. A mere **four days** after being linked to **Tilray/Aphira merger**, a company that is strongly associated with both Aphria and **Brady Cobb is bought to help consolidate Florida**. I think AYR is now on TEAM BRITISH TOBACCO.\\n\\n**1/12/2021: THE KOCH BROTHERS** \\\\- Key executive **Parker Poling at the Republican National Conference Committee** leaves in order to join lobbyist **Harbinger Strategies. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE END**. Remember Harbinger is from all the way at the beginning.\\n\\n**1/14/2021: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **Brady Cobb** continues his one-month massive **Florida consolidation**. **Cresco purchases Brady Cobb\\'s Bluma Wellness**. This is the spin off from SOL Global, which he ran with **Michael Serruya** and Andy DeFrancesco. Michael Serruya is most associated with **MedMen** (he will invest $100M in them in August, and become their CEO in November.). Remember this **Cobb/Serruya connection for a later NY/Florida asset swap between ALTRIA and BRITISH TOBACCO groups.**\\n\\n**1/25/2021: ALTRIA / KOCH** \\\\- The **United States Cannabis Council (ALTRIA)** registers as lobbyist for themselves with $220k initial expense. They also register on the **same day as lobbyists for The Global Alliance for Cannabis Commerce (KOCH)**. Remember, his is the advocacy group associated with Koch via Randal Meyers, who is associated with Canopy Growth (BRITISH TOBACCO) through DNA Genetics. Randal Meyers is on US Cannabis Council\\'s lobbying registration.\\n\\n**1/27/2021: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- Remember my previous connections with ATACH (cannabis/hemp council.) On this day they created a \"**beverage council**\". Remember Constellation Brands runs Canopy. I think part of the deal is to give the California and US beverages to Canopy and others. The Cali cannabis market is already too diverse to try to consolidate now.\\n\\n**IMPORTANT DATE BELOW 🌿**\\n\\n**2/8/2021: ALTRIA** \\\\- The United States Cannabis Council is officially formed with interem Chairman law firm Vicente Sederberg. They go back with this group a while. The **CEO is Steve Hawkins from Marijuana Policy Project** (who replaced Rob Kampia when he was ousted after admitting to accepting tobacco exec money). So we have **Curaleaf/Cronos/Dutchie/MPP on at the top of the United States Cannabis Council (ALTRIA).** Dutchie\\'s investors are unclear, but we know at least **Snoop Dogg\\'s Case Verde Capital** is a significant stakeholder. **Remember Snoop for later**. We also now have B**oehner/Cresco/Trulieve at the top of the National Cannabis Roundtable (BRITISH TOBACCO).**\\n\\nNote that right after this key council formed, the market has gone into a **2 year, straight down decline**. I\\'m no longer convince that\\'s a coincidence. And people who know me, know that I actually hate the whole \"hedge fund\\'s are shorting\" talk.\\n\\n**2/9/2021: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- A single day after the US Cannabis Council is formed, **Green Thumb Industries and Verano Holdings quietly formed a joint venture ILDISP LLC** that will later be accused of facilitating **price fixing using Akerna** (per lawsuit). Note that **Verano Holdings formed on 10/23/2018 explicitly for the purpose of consolidating National Cannabis Assets**. At launch, they received funding from **Scythian Biosciences (Cobb/Serruya/Aphria connect**), and attempted to purchase **Brady Cobb\\'s 3 Boys Farm in Florida**. Brady Cobb is all over this deal, and it fits his Florida consolidation strategy.\\n\\n**3/1/2021: ALTRIA** \\\\- **Columbia Care** engages with lobbyist **BHFS**. They currently lobby with The United **States Cannabis Council.** Remember this for the end.\\n\\n**3/17/2021: ALTRIA** \\\\- **Columbia Care** engages with lobbyist **Fulcrum Public Affairs**. Fulcrum Public Affairs lobbies for **Altria via Juul**. Two of their lobbyist overlap on disclosures.\\n\\n**TWO IMPORTANT DATES 🌿**\\n\\n**4/1/2021: ALTRIA - Bill to legalize recreational sales in NY is officially signed. The race is on.**\\n\\n**4/6/2021: KOCH BROTHERS** \\\\- In a surprise move, **The Koch Brothers** form a cannabis \"advocacy\" group **The Cannabis Freedom Alliance**. This group was formed after a zoom call with **Snoop Dogg**, who owns a large stake in **Dutchie through Case Verde Capital**. Dutchie is a primary board member for **US Cannabis Council (ALTRIA)**. The two groups of the 4 in it to focus on are **The Global Alliance for Cannabis Commerce and The Weldon Project.** Brief review below:\\n\\n**Global Alliance for Cannabis Commerce** \\\\- Remember them from earlier, as the Randal Meyer group linked to **Koch and the US Cannabis Council via Curaleaf**\\'s previous associations with the Cannabis Trade Federation. **Randal Meyer is a co-founder of Koch\\'s new Cannabis Freedom Alliance**. They are already linked to **Koch/Canopy via Randal Meyers**, and formed not long after the **RNCC exec left to join Harbinger Strategies**.\\n\\n**The Weldon Project.** Another \"advocacy\" group. This group brings together **Cresco** (major partner) and **Miracle Gro** (Funds through \"Hawthorne Social Justice Fund\") with the **Koch Brothers**. Later will be joined by **Verano Holdings**. On the \"team\" of the Weldon Project is **Brady Cobb**. Brady Cobb is directly linked to **Cresco (BGR/Bluma), Verano (3 Boys Farm, Scythian, etc.) and Miracle Gro (BGR lobbying).** I think this establishes Cresco (and specifically **Brady Cobb**) and **Miracle Gro** as a primary connection for Team ALTRIA and Team BRITISH TOBACCO to coordinate with Koch, using the Weldon Project. They\\'ve been intermediaries in this conspiracy for years, as I\\'ve shown.\\n\\n**5/10/2021: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- Trulieve announces Harvest Health merger. Florida consolidation continues.\\n\\n**6/14/2021: Altria** \\\\- **Altria invests via Cronos** for about 10% owndership of **PharmaCann**. This investment is advised by **McGuireWoods**. The **Koch linked Global Alliance for Cannabis Commerce used McGuireWoods Consulting** on their initial lobbying disclosure. They registered, formed the GACC, then the next filing was termination. **Randal Meyer (Koch/Rand Paul**) is on the initial lobbying registration.\\n\\n**8/4/21: ALTRIA** \\\\- Jessica Billingsley from **Akerna takes over CEO at United States Cannabis Council**. Akerna will later be accused in a lawsuit of facilitating price fixing among Chicago-based companies. I think the reason such a random, nearly defunct company is at the head of this major organization, is specifically because they are coordinating things using their data capabilities.\\n\\n**11/22/21: ALTRIA** \\\\- **Medmen** appoints **Michael Serruya as CEO**. He goes way back with **Brady Cobb**.\\n\\n**1/3/22: ALTRIA** \\\\- **Medmen** attempts to \"**unilaterally pull out of the deal\" to sell NY assets** to Ascend Wellness. **Remember this for later.**\\n\\n**2/7/22: ALTRIA** \\\\- **Miracle Gro** engages w/ lobbyist **Fulcrum (Columbia Care registered w/ them almost a year ago**). Miracle Gro currently has strong connection to **Cresco/Brady Cobb, who are soon to announce a merger with Columbia Care.**\\n\\n**3/23/22: ALTRIA / BRITISH TOBACCO - Merger between Cresco and Columbia Care** announced. No coincedance Brady Cobb/Miracle Gro just connected them via Fulcrum. Yet again following the pattern of register/major deal/actually file disclosure. This deal contains a lot of **New York and Florida assets.**\\n\\n**3/30/22: ALTRIA** \\\\- **New York** assets are assembling as **Miracle Gro announces purchasing Etain** via their investment subsidiary RIV Capital. Again, I don\\'t think it\\'s a coincidence this is **one week after the major merger between Cresco/Columbia Care** is announced.\\n\\n**6/17/22: ALTRIA** \\\\- A **Health and Equity partner for US Cannabis Council** leaves the group, citing that they are **prioritizing corporations over equity.**\\n\\n**6/27/22: ALTRIA** \\\\- **Miracle Gro engages w/ lobbyist BHSF**. They currently lobby with the **US Cannabis Council and Columbia Care**. This is the **ALTRIA\\'s side of negotiations** of the merger. We now have Miracle Gro/Cresco/and Brady Cobb at the center of discussions.\\n\\n(Note that while we have discussed Brady Cobb\\'s Florida consolidation, you can find many interviews where Miracle Gro\\'s head Hagedorn talks about how he wants to expand into cannabis, with NY at the centerpiece, when tax situations make it viable to do so. He specifically mentions taking large equity stakes in multiple MSOs. **Hagedorn is working with Brady Cobb through BGR to help split up Florida and New York between them.)**\\n\\n**8/18/22: ALTRIA** \\\\- The **New York assets from MedMen** **are retained** after a long fight\\n\\n**9/1/22: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- The **Florifa assets from MedMen are acquired by Brady Cobb**\\'s company **Green Sentry Holdings**. The **ALTRIA group and the BRITISH TOBACCO group literally just swapped assets for their desired markets.**\\n\\n**10/1/22: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- The merger of Trulieve and Harvest Health closes. Florida is locked down. They need New York.\\n\\n**IMPORTANT THREE EVENTS BELOW ON SAME DAY**  **🌿**\\n\\n**11/4/22: ALTRIA** \\\\- **Cresco** finally is able to negotiate the sale of **NY Assets to P. Diddy**. The merger with Columbia Care, brokered by Miracle Gro, Altria, and British Tobacco, is getting close. Remember, Cresco is leading TEAM BRITISH TOBACCO while Curaleaf is leading TEAM ALTRIA.\\n\\n**11/4/22: ALTRIA** \\\\- **Curaleaf engages lobbyist BHFS with a $130,000 payment**\\n\\n**11/4/22: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **Cresco engages lobbyist BHFS with a $130,000 payment**. Exact same filings, on same date, on lobbyist recently associated with **Miracle Gro and the US Cannabis Council**.\\n\\nSo we hit 2023 with **Cresco/Trulieve/Verano/Green Thumb/Green Sentry/Liberty Health/MedMen/Canopy/Acreage/Surterra (Parallel)** all linked strongly together **consolidating** **Florida assets for BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO aka the National Cannabis Roundtable**. This is a massive % of the huge Florida market, as well as most of the Chicago market.\\n\\nThen we have **Curaleaf/Cronos/Miracle Gro/PharmaCann/Dutchie/Etain/Tilray/Medmen** all connected **consolidating New York assets for TEAM ALTRIA aka team US Cannabis Council**.\\n\\nOk so remember **Harbinger Strategies**? The lobbying firm from the very beginning. The one with Big Tech, Big Banks, and Constellation Brands? The lobbying firm later adding an RNCC exec right before the US Cannabis Council is formed. Well.....\\n\\n**1/1/23: ALTRIA- Altria engages with lobbyist Harbinger Strategies.**\\n\\nHoly shit, this could be massive. It\\'s just a shame that **British American Tobacco has not registered a lobbyist since 2001**, so I could link this directly to the entire conspiracy. Oh wait…..\\n\\n**1/1/23: BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- **British American Tobacco** registers with a lobbyist for the **FIRST TIME SINCE 2001** with lobbyist **Capitol Consulting Group LLC**.\\n\\n**1/3/23: ALTRIA/BRITISH TOBACCO** \\\\- The **Investment Company Institute** who manages trillions of assets worldwide, **registers with Harbinger Strategies.**\\n\\n**THEN THIS WEEK 06/07/2023:** Rumours that $CURLF (Curaleaf) is will buyout $CRON (Cronos), who got a mid-day stock **TRADING HALT** and both companies put out a Press Release noted above  💣 💥\\n\\n**$MO (Altria) had a $71,424,872 (Million) DARK POOL print go thru the tape on Friday.**  🐳\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dtfj44xt6uab1.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=55f9bf19abf2248428b660fc4c4f2b9677142c15\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIt\\'s clear that the \"Big Money / Smart Money\" is starting to position and make moves **ahead of USA Federal Legislation** (SAFE Banking Act + HHS Biden Administration [https://twitter.com/SecBecerra](https://twitter.com/SecBecerra) Rescheduling before the end of 2023).\\n\\nOnce this happens and **USA Cannabis companies** up-list to the NYSE / NASDAQ + institution money is able to come in and invest, the USA Cannabis stock prices will have a **VIOLENT RE-RATING HIGHER!** 🌿 📈\\n\\nLet\\'s see if we get official news over the next few days / weeks on this deal happening.\\n\\nThe USA Cannabis space is a **GENERATIONAL BUYING OPPORTUNIY** near **all time low** **stock prices** (and are **HIGHLY SHORTED** over the past 5 years) with **multiple catalyst** lined up for the second half of 2023! 🤫\\n\\n**Thanks for reading my TED TALK!** 🙏\\n\\n\\\\--------------\\n\\n**EDIT: (Sunday, July 7th)**\\n\\n**BOOM! \"Schumer outlines Senate agenda (SAFE Banking Act)** \" 💎   🙌  🐵   -->  🍋  ✊  📈\\n\\n**Let\\'s see if more \"Strategics\" (Big Tabaco, Big Alcohol, Big Pharma) start to make big moves in the coming days / weeks / months!**   🌊  😎\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t82hmsxshzab1.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=a869baf0b010115fd9401d49f06197c29ea0a3bb\\n\\nAlso don\\'t forget that other **CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) Companies** are looking at the Cannabis sector too!

Investment houses thrive on it. To go out there in a bubble and talk about badly overpriced markets and downside risks is an invitation to get fired. They simply don't want to hear it…”*\\n\\n\\\\- Jeremy Grantham on Charlie Rose, March 11, 2013. Grantham is a renowned value investor who famously lost half of his investor base after refusing to buy into the tech bubble of the late ‘90s but was ultimately proven correct when NASDAQ fell by nearly 80%.\\n\\nToday, once again, there are two prevailing theories for what is happening in the economy. The first, and more common, goes something like this:\\n\\n*While rising interest rates have slowed things a bit, the economy is generally healthy and more resilient than many expected, and ultimately inflation is coming down, so eventually the Fed will begin lowering rates, and we will see either a soft landing or potentially a mild slowdown… but actually things are overall pretty good.*\\n\\nThe second theory — *our* stated opinion — goes more like this:\\n\\n*The effects of rising rates have yet to really start impacting things. It’s not that the economy is strong so much as it just takes a long time for these things to play out. The current period of seemingly little impact has created a false sense of confidence, and, like a dam that is structurally flawed, the pressure is building slowly, but most will not realize anything is wrong until that final tipping point when the pressure ultimately becomes too great, and the dam breaks.*\\n\\nAs usual, our belief here stems not from any ability to see into the future, but simply from fundamental analysis of how similar patterns have repeated and played out in the past.\\n\\nTo highlight this fact, we’ve put together a series of graphs to demonstrate visually the interplay between rising rates and economic downturns over the past 70+ years.\\n\\nTo begin, let's look back at the last major recession, the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. Even for those who experienced the run up of the early 2000s that ultimately ended with the collapse of the financial system, the events of that time period appear compressed. The truth of course is that they were not.\\n\\nThen, as now, there was **a long lag between the cause and effect**. And that delay misled markets. As far back as 2004, the Fed began raising interest rates from a low of 1% to the peak of 5.25%, which occurred in the summer of 2006. From that point of peak interest rates, it took roughly another 18 months before the official start of the recession in January 2008.\\n\\nOf course, few, if any, knew that we were actually in a recession, even at that point. In fact, the stock market was still near its historic highs, and it took roughly another 12 months before the stock market reached its bottom in February 2009 — down more than 50% — *a full 2.5 years after* interest rates had peaked.\\n\\n[Fed Funds rate and recession dates sourced from Federal Reserve Economic Data \\\\(FRED\\\\).

However, it took roughly another 9 months before the recession began in summer 1981, and another full year after that point before the stock market reached its bottom in the summer of 1982, having once again fallen more than 30%.\\n\\n[Fed Funds rate and recession dates sourced from Federal Reserve Economic Data \\\\(FRED\\\\).

And importantly there’s been a similar lag in each period between reaching the peak interest rate, the start of the recession, and the bottom of the stock market.\\n\\nIn other words, despite the oft-repeated refrain from many pundits, the stock market is in fact a lagging — *NOT* a leading — indicator of recessions.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbuteif76d9b1.png?width=1548&format=png&auto=webp&s=2821bc9e667f1590a5e5ad2a02d3b470918ff35a\\n\\nSo what does this mean for investors today?\\n\\nFed Chairman Powell has recently made clear to the market that he intends to continue with at least one, if not several, additional rate hikes this year (the most recent Q1 GDP data likely only furthers his resolve on this point).\\n\\nIf we take the Fed's own forecast, rates will peak in December of this year. Assuming the average lag times from previous recessions, this would mean the recession would not actually begin until October of 2024, while the stock market would not reach its bottom until the Fall of 2025, with a roughly 30-40% decline from where it stands today. Although it could happen sooner, the point is that the lag is much longer than most people recognize.\\n\\nBetween now and then, history suggests we may experience what we might call a **FOMO trap** as the stock market delivers a series of rallies and subsequent dips (much as we’ve seen recently) as it stair steps its way down to an eventual floor, like it has in every recession going back to the 1950s.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/keiw6oea6d9b1.png?width=1524&format=png&auto=webp&s=12b40659fd89386feb1000b04b100ae47bc5701d\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDespite what some may now believe after the past 15 years, markets don’t always go up. And as sure as night follows day, economic downturns have followed every major period of monetary tightening since WWII. And we cannot today see how this time is poised to be any different.\\n\\nIn fact, the aforementioned Jeremy Grantham also noted that “Of the 33 \\\\[bubbles\\\\] that have ended, every one broke all the way back — not halfway back — to the trend before the bubble started.”\\n\\nBut analysis, of course, is not actually the difficult part. While the data exists for all of us to see, it’s human nature that makes following through on this insight so challenging; the ability to maintain the long view in the face of all the headlines and social media touting a rising stock market. In truth it is FOMO, or the lack thereof, that separates the great investors from the herd over the long run.\"}, {'text': '*Let\\'s do the shotgun approach.* I\\'m going to be discussing all five earning plays in one post, and then put my conclusions at the end. All of these stocks are putting out earnings today, after hours. Yesterday I posted about HPQ going down, and it went down, puts up ~80%. So let\\'s get into the details of this post. \\n\\nStarting with **CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD)**, where analysts are predicting earnings of $0.509 per share compared to earnings of $0.310 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They are also expecting the company to report $677.4 million, an increase of over the prior year quarter when the company reported $487.8 million. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $2.33, while the previous year saw a profit of $1.54.\\n\\nCrowdStrike’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are likely to reflect the benefits of the continued solid demand for its products, given the healthy environment of the global security market. The increasing number of people logging into employers\\' networks has triggered a greater need for security and might have spurred the demand for CRWD’s products in the fiscal first quarter. A strong pipeline of deals indicates the same.\\n\\nStellar revenue growth in subscriptions might have contributed significantly to the first quarter’s top line. Further, the increasing number of net new subscription customers may have acted as a tailwind.\\n\\nMoreover, CrowdStrike’s collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an upside, benefiting the company from its products’ availability on the AWS platform. The expansion in the volume of transactions through Amazon’s AWS Marketplace, growth in co-selling opportunities with AWS salesforce and the uptake of AWS service integrations are likely to have contributed to CRWD’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.\\n\\nHowever, elevated expenses for enhancing sales and marketing capabilities and increased investments in research and development are likely to have weighed on the company’s fiscal first-quarter bottom line.\\n\\nNext is the software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider **Salesforce (CRM)**, wallstreet expects CRM to post adjusted earnings of $1.61 per share, which is on the higher end of the company’s guidance and nearly double that of the Q1FY23 figure of $0.98 per share. CRM has consistently beaten earnings expectations in the [past eight quarters](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crm/earnings), with a strategically built portfolio covering virtually all aspects of digital transformation. So far this year, the stock has gained 59.9%, outperforming the S&P 500\\'s 10% gain.\\n\\nSimilarly, the analysts expect Salesforce to post revenue of $8.18 billion, which is also on the higher end of the company’s outlook and represents a 10.4% year-over-year growth. However, sequentially, the revenue expectation shows a modest decline of 2.4%.\\n\\nSalesforce’s first-quarter performance is likely to have gained from its focus on building and expanding relationships with leading brands across industries and geographies. Also, significant growth opportunities in the public sector are expected to have been a tailwind in the fiscal first quarter.\\n\\nThe company’s ability to offer integrated solutions for customers’ business problems is likely to have been a key growth driver. The firm’s products, like Trailhead and myTrailhead, are helping companies through their transformation processes and increasing business scale with modern technology.\\n\\nSalesforce’s quarterly performance is likely to have benefited from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The customer relationship management software provider’s focus on introducing more aligned products per customer needs is expected to have boosted its top line in the quarter.\\n\\nAlso, the acquisitions of Slack, Mobify and Vlocity are anticipated to have aided CRM’s top line during the to-be-reported quarter. Growth across its four major cloud service offerings, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Platform, and Other and Marketing & Commerce Cloud, is anticipated to have boosted Salesforce’s subscriptions and supported its revenues.\\n\\nHowever, a decline in software spending by small and medium businesses amid the macroeconomic uncertainty due to the pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war might have affected Salesforce’s fiscal first-quarter performance. Further, stiff competition from Oracle and Microsoft is a concern, along with forex headwinds.\\n\\nOn May 26, Goldman Sachs analyst [Kash Rangan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kashrangan/) reiterated his Buy rating on CRM stock ahead of its earnings report. Rangan has set a price target of $325, implying a massive 50.8% upside potential from current levels.  \\n\\nRangan is highly optimistic about Salesforce’s quarterly winning streak and the potential tailwind from the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Even so, the analyst cited that this will be the first time that CRM will recognize a sequential decline in subscription revenue.\\n\\nDespite that, Rangan noted, “As a system of record with a plethora of customer data that can help train its LLM (large language models), CRM can benefit from Generative AI. As the macro begins to inflect, we see CRM being well positioned as it realizes the benefits from sales efficiency efforts and workforce reductions of recent quarters.” Salesforce said it will integrate its [generative AI](https://www.crmscience.com/single-post/generative-ai-and-salesforce-transforming-business-processes-with-innovative-ai-solutions) Einstein GPT into every facet of the company - sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT interaction. Pricing details were not disclosed.\\n\\nI know everyone wants to hear it, next is **C3.ai (AI)**. There\\'s no denying it, the growing popularity of artificial intelligence, in particular ChatGPT, is more than just hype. It is real. As you may have noticed, one company that\\'s riding high on the AI wave is C3.ai, which has seen its stock more than doubled as interest among investors surge. The stock has gone on a breathtaking run over the past thirty days, rising close to 90%, compared with the 3% rise in the S&P 500 index. On a year-to-date basis the performance looks even more astonishing, skyrocketing 194% compared with the 10% rise in the S&P 500 index. How much higher can its shares go?\\n\\nC3.ai is benefiting from the increasing adoption of its services, including C3 Generative AI Product Suite, C3 AI Ex Machina (wasn\\'t that a movie?), C3 AI ESG and C3 AI CRM. An expanding product portfolio is expected to have remained a key catalyst in driving demand for the company’s fully-integrated AI products in the fiscal fourth quarter.\\n\\nDuring the to-be-reported quarter, the company made significant development toward its Generative AI platform, facilitating the ease of use and the capability of its enterprise AI applications. This is expected to have driven the top line.\\n\\nC3.ai has been benefiting from strengthening industry and technology-specific partnerships. From its industry partnerships with the likes of Baker Hughes in oil & gas & chemical markets and Booz Allen in government defense sector, C3.ai has been leveraging domain expertise to expand its customer footprint.\\n\\nWith its tech partners, C3 has been benefiting from strength in its sales capabilities besides tech and product functionality. Partnerships with the likes of Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure and Accenture are expected to have driven the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.\\n\\nAside from recently announcing that its generative AI product suite is now available as a public offer on Alphabet\\'s Google (GOOG , GOOGL) Cloud Marketplace, the company also issued preliminary results that included positive cash flow in FQ4. This suggests that the company’s $800 million cash currently on its balance sheet will grow. Its management has sought to change the company’s business model, shifting the business away from short-term revenues to a transaction-based pricing method, while boosting long-term revenues by growing its customer base.\\n\\nThose initiatives appear to be working with growth rates starting to re-accelerate. CEO Thomas Siebel said, \"Since we announced C3 Generative AI, we\\'ve had intense interest from current customers and prospects to get these capabilities deployed and in use across their systems.” The product suite features enterprise search, allowing businesses to search across their database to locate and retrieve relevant information. On Wednesday, the company will look to prove that it is here to stay and has a sustainable path towards profitability.\\n\\nFor the three months that ended April, Wall Street expects the Redwood City, Calif.-based company to post a per-share loss of 17 cents on revenue of $71.32 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the loss was 21 cents per share on revenue of $72.32 million. For the full year, the loss is expected to be 46 cents per share, narrowing from 73 cents a year ago, while full-year revenue of $265.67 million would rise 5.1% year over year.\\n\\nThe company still has a lot to prove and important questions to answer. Namely, does it have a strong enough moat to establish a leadership position in enterprise AI software? C3.ai ended Q3 with 236 customers, the same total reported at the end of Q2. In other words, there has been no sequential growth in the customer base, suggesting there’s a lack in competitive advantage and/or product interest.\\n\\nAs noted earlier, a few quarters ago, the company moved towards a new pricing model to help onboard new customers at a lower startup cost. This will allow the company to charge more when these same customers utilize the software at higher levels. As a result of the pricing change, there was a noticeable dip in Q3 revenues. Although the company surpassed consensus estimates, producing Q3 revenue $66.67 million, the figure declined 4.45% year over year.\\n\\nThe Q3 adjusted loss of 6 cents per share did surpass estimates by 16 cents. Despite the nearly 5% dip in revenues, the stock soared higher. Investors looked beyond the current numbers and instead focused on the fact that the trough in revenues had been reached. The belief is that the company’s consumption-based pricing model is now poised to generate even more revenue than the subscription model it once used. As such, the guidance the company provides today will be a key factor in the stock’s near-term direction.\\n\\nStrong demand for the company’s Enterprise AI software, driven by accelerated digital modernization across major industries, is expected to have aided fiscal fourth-quarter performance.\\n\\n**Okta, Inc (OKTA)** is next. analysts expect earnings of $0.118 per share compared to losses of $0.270 per share from the same quarter last year. They expect Okta to report sales of $511.0 million, an increase of 23.16% over the same period last year. Looking at the full year, analysts expect a profit of $0.760 per share. In the previous year there was a profit of $0.040 per share.\\n\\nThe company’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are expected to reflect the benefits of increased use cases of identity solutions and an expanding product portfolio.\\n\\nOkta is expected to have experienced strong demand for its Workforce and Customer Identity solutions. Continuous innovation in its solutions have helped Okta score notable enterprises such as Sonos, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, MassMutual and OpenAI. Its products’ ability to automate processes, secure data and reduce costs has been another positive.\\n\\nDemand for the company’s solutions has been strong due to the deployment of cloud and hybrid IT, digital transformation projects and the adoption of Zero Trust security. The momentum is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.\\n\\nThese factors are expected to have expanded the customer base in the fiscal first quarter. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Okta added 550 customers, bringing the total customer count to 17,600, up 17% year over year. Customers with more than $100K in Annual Contract Value increased 27% year over year.\\n\\nHowever, Okta is expected to have faced challenges in execution and heightened attrition. Challenging macro environment and unfavourable forex are potential headwinds. These factors are expected to have hurt its fiscal fourth-quarter prospects.\\n\\nFinally, let\\'s take a look at **Nordstrom (JWN)**. Their first-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to reflect the significant impacts of decelerating demand trends. Reduced consumer spending amid lower income groups, stemming from the tough macroeconomic environment, has been hurting revenues across both banners. Analysts expect losses of $0.105 per share compared to losses of $0.060 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They also are expecting the company to report $3.16 billion, an decrease of 11.59% over the prior year quarter. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $1.87, while the previous year saw a profit of $1.69.\\n\\nManagement expects the impact of the winding down of Canada operations to hurt revenues in fiscal 2023. The impacts of the closure are likely to get reflected in the fiscal first-quarter results. I anticipate a decline in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, I expect sales to decline for both the Nordstrom banner and  the Nordstrom Rack segment.\\n\\nIn order to maintain healthy inventory levels, Nordstrom has been undertaking additional markdowns. The higher markdowns have been weighing on gross margin, which is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.\\n\\nHowever, the company is committed to enhancing customer experience via its Closer to You strategy, optimized supply chain and better efficiency. These endeavors are expected to have slightly offset the aforementioned declines.\\n\\nNordstrom has been focused on technology advancement by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, supply-chain channel improvement, and marketing efforts. The digital business has been witnessing gains from improved digital traffic across both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, as well as increased utilization of Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store service. Its mobile app has also been performing well. Alongside these, the integration of Rack.com into [Nordstrom.com](https://www.nordstrom.com/) is anticipated to have contributed to the company\\'s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.\\n\\n**So what to do for earnings?**\\n\\nJust to keep it sweet and simple, I\\'m getting calls on CRWD, CRM, AI, and OKTA. And I\\'m getting puts on JWN. I don\\'t expect all of them to hit, I just like to throw my money on the table and see what flies. Keep in mind tho, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.'}, {'text': \"*Mods, y'all haven't liked my DD on the last couple of occasions.

Well...\\n\\n# Stratasys and Desktop Metal to merge and flip Nano Dimension the bird\\n\\n  \\nOn May 25th, 2023, Stratasys and Desktop Metal announced a proposed **all-stock merger** that has been in the works for over a year *(as per remarks in the joint call)*. **Desktop Metal stockholders will receive 0.123 ordinary shares of Stratasys for each share of Desktop Metal** Class A common stock. The purchase consideration implies a **premium of 7.4%** to Desktop Metal's May 24th closing price of $1.75 to Stratasys's May 24th closing price of $14.88. Stratasys shareholders will own approximately 59% of the combined company, and Desktop Metal stockholders will hold about 41%. The combination will **strengthen the balance sheets**, provide even **greater synergies and cost reductions**, and the **complementary portfolio** of the two entities' solutions show little to no overlap - **creating the undisputed and largest industry** leader in the additive manufacturing space. Following on from **Stratasys's achievement of profitability** and **Desktop Metal's projection to reach adj.EBITDA breakeven in Q3 or Q4**, the joint entity forecasts **revenue of $1.1B by 2025**.   \\n\\n\\nLess than one hour after the announcement, **Nano Dimension announced** its fourth unsolicited tender offer in an **attempt to acquire Stratasys in a hostile takeover**. *“As we had previously indicated to the Stratasys Board, given their continued refusal to engage in negotiations, we have decided to present our offer directly to Stratasys’ shareholders,”* [said Yoav Stern](https://investors.nano-di.com/press-releases/news-details/2023/Nano-Dimension-Launches-18.00-Per-Share-All-Cash-Special-Tender-Offer-to-Increase-Ownership-in-Stratasys-to-between-53-and-55-of-Its-Outstanding-Shares/default.aspx), Nano Dimension’s Chairman and CEO. Indeed, a quick glance at Nano's press releases, social media and conference calls reveals **a tirade of slander, misinformation and hostilities toward Stratasys**.  Unsurprisingly **this was met with a fourth rejection** from the board, [who cited](https://assets.website-files.com/646d3ff4f45630efe69682f1/6475f000bec55dc42ede16a4_Stratasys%20Board%20of%20Directors%20Unanimously%20Rejects%20Nano%20Dimension’s%20Partial%20Tender%20Offer.pdf) the **questionable legality, morality   and motives of Nano**. This comes at a time when **Nano Dimension is already in deep legal trouble with its investors**, namely Murchison. According to Murchinson, the meeting saw **92% of the votes cast supported Murchinson’s proposal to remove four directors from the Nano board, including Yoav Stern, Chief Executive Officer** and Chairman of Nano Dimension.\\n\\nAt the same time as this rejection, **Desktop Metal** [announced](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/news/press-releases/detail/151/desktop-metal-inc-adopts-limited-duration-shareholder) a **temporary poison pill** which expires either in mid-2024 or upon completion of the merger. Given that **Stratasys already has one** in place and there would be **no way for Nano to acquire Stratasys** without unsolicited shareholder offers *(which are extremely unlikely to succeed).*  Desktop Metal's temporary poison pill filing is therefore a safety measure to prevent Nano from enacting a hostile takeover or causing interference with the merger.   \\n\\n\\n**Despite** a significant amount of **cash and equivalents totalling over $1B** on hand and some pretty cool tech operating in a highly important market, **Nano Dimension's revenue has been a paltry $43.6M for FY2022**, and even that represents 316% growth and a 1,200% YoY. Sadly it seems that despite much interest over the last few years **Nano Dimension is ultimately a company with no viability and incredibly poor leadership** who have steered the company into the ground. Given that **Nano also have a poison pill, this unfortunately means they could not be acquired themselves** and therefore the writing is on the wall. \\n\\n# Draaaamaaaaa! So, what does this mean for the valuation? \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nGiven the merger being all-stock, Desktop Metal shareholders will receive 0.123 Stratasys shares per 1 Desktop Metal share. Stratasys currently has 68.4M shares outstanding, and therefore this would create 39.53M new shares to create a grand total of 107.93M shares outstanding.   \\n\\n\\nIn 2025 the joint entity forecasts revenue of $1.1B with a margin 10-12% (totalling $110M+ profit). Using the average multiple of 20x, this would place the valuation at **$2.2B by 2025 - equating to $20.37 per share**. The AM 2.0 industry is expected to grow to $100B by 2030 assuming a 25%CAGR, and the combined entity still expects to capture at least 10% market share. This would place revenue at $10B in 2030 and profit of $1B using the 10-12% margin given. The average forward multiple for a stock is 20-25x, placing the valuation at **$20B with the stock price at $185.12 in 2030 as a base case**. Given the unforeseen global events of the past three years, even implying a time-based discount of 30% (i.e, roughly three years behind schedule) still puts the shares price at roughly $130. Assuming both Desktop Metal and Stratasys continue to deliver on their promises, increase margins and capture a higher portion of the market by 2030, I predict that the **shares could be worth upwards of $555 assuming a 30% market share in the bull case**. \\n\\nGiven the increasing demand for AM 2.0 solutions and backing by various national entities such as the [US Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2022/05/09/using-additive-manufacturing-to-improve-supply-chain-resilience-and-bolster-small-and-mid-size-firms/) during a time where supply times are being reevaluated and re-shored, I believe that the time for 3D printing to dominate is upon us. With existing customers as the two companies already have, it is not a matter of 'if' but 'when'. \\n\\n# What's the trade? \\n\\n  \\nWell, there's lots of ways to play this.   \\n\\n\\nPersonally I am continuing to go long with my position in Desktop Metal on the basis that profitability is reached by the end of the year - regardless of the merger proposal. In my opinion, there is profound upside here should the deal go through or not. Average analyst estimate is currently $2.50 and the shares currently trade at $1.84 around significant support. I believe that should Desktop Metal announce profitability at some point in Q3 where the apex of the downtrend lies (August) there could be a significant and sustained pop in the stock up to around $5. Personally I feel that this is where the opportunity lies, and where the growth post-merger is overwhelmingly going to come from. I'd consider shares or LEAPs over short-term options to allow a margin of error.   \\n\\n\\nDue to ongoing hostilities with Nano Dimension I would be unlikely to consider opening a trade in Stratasys for  more than $8, particularly given inconsistencies in their profitability. I would prefer to wait and observe developments in these areas. Should Stratasys release consecutive positive quarters I would certainly reconsider my evaluations.   \\n\\n\\nNano Dimension in my opinion could be an easy short when things inevitably deteriorate with Murchison and Yoav in court, but that's not a game I play.   \\n\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThere is so much more information than I could ever possibly condense into a post, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter.\"}, {'text': \" \\n\\nHello Autists, \\n\\nToday I am presenting Redfin (RDFN) and why it can and will be a 200% play over the next two years. Yes, I did say 200%. Just on stock, not even counting options. Let's jump in. \\n\\n**Investment Thesis:** Redfin a super cyclical stock will be rebounding with great strength due to Online Real Estate Market Growth, AI investments, diverse Revenue Streams, and most importantly shrinking interest rate environment to kick it all off. They also got rid of their Buying program and implemented for the first time now the Redfin Premier Nationwide service to homebuyers. \\n\\n***What is Redfin?***\\n\\nRedfin is a residential online real estate brokerage. The company uses technologies such as map search and virtual house showings to increase exposure, improve the quality of the customer experience, all while delivering efficiencies and saving the consumer costs. Redfin also provides the ability to do digital and online document management making it a one stop shop for one’s real estate needs. \\n\\nThey also use the same combination of technology and local service to originate mortgage loans and offer title and settlement services. They also offer digital platforms to connect consumers with available apartments and houses for rent.\\n\\n**Their mission is to redefine real estate in favor of the consumer. To change an industry that has had little disruption. Redfin's business model to undercut competition is based on sellers paying Redfin a discounted fee, either 1 or 1.5% to list the seller's home.**\\n\\nReal Estate agents have to be the biggest thieves taking 6% commission being a realtor. Every $1,000,000 home sold equals $60,000 in fees for a license that can be earned in 75 classroom hours. And requires no technical skills or degree. Nothing against real estate agents, but after watching Selling Sunset on Netflix and working in real estate investments myself, I am ready to see the real estate market adapt, and move past agents who don’t provide more than $20 of value and headaches saying “Location, location, location” so I can buy more FD and OTD’s in my brokerage**.** \\n\\n**Investment Thesis Catalysts:** \\n\\n**Online Real Estate Market Growth and Market Share:** There is ongoing shift towards online platforms in the real estate industry that present an opportunity for Redfin to capture a larger share of the market. As more homebuyers and sellers embrace digital solutions, Redfin's technology-driven approach and user-friendly platform could lead to increased adoption and market penetration.\\n\\nIf any of you autists have ever used RDFN then you know first hand that there is a smooth process with limited conflict of interest since their agents are not commission based. People are becoming tired of the fees posed by traditional agents. Even though there has been a slow down in revenues across the real estate brokerage industry, going forward in a digital world I expect this to continue to grow. \\n\\nRedfin currently only has .78% of the entire market share in the US….there is room for growth for this billion dollar market cap company where they are actually not being thieves for 6%. \\n\\nThe company's growth initiatives, such as geographic expansion and strategic partnerships, will contribute to its market dominance and attract more customers. **They just initiated Redfin Premier Nationwide.**\\n\\nRedfin Premier is a specialized service that caters to high-end and luxury properties. It is designed to provide enhanced marketing and representation for luxury homes in select markets.Redfin Premier offers a range of features and services to sellers and buyers of luxury properties. These may include professional photography and video tours, custom marketing materials, targeted online advertising, and exposure on high-traffic websites and publications. And you know what they say…luxury products bring luxury margins. \\n\\n**Redfin also launched in 2022 their acquisition from 2021 RentPath**, because lets be honest owning a home for many people right now is a pipedream and now has a rental search. This creates a new pipeline of consumers in different phases of life and I don’t know how many of y’all have been apartment shopping recently but damn these rents just keep going up. While Redfin is known for home buying and selling services… apartment rentals is a new slice of the pie to grow into. And most of the time M&A is a waste of time but this I think added value to Redfin. \\n\\n**AI Investments:** I knew by putting AI in this, some of yall would make your keyboard sticky. They are making continued investments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analysis to make sure they provide personalized recommendations, improve user experience, and streamline the home buying and selling process to take consumer money and make us tendies. \\n\\n**Industry Trends:**\\n\\nReal Estate transactions have gotten wrecked. Interest rates affect this industry a fuck ton. Redfin’s share price has plummeted since 2022. Interest rates and recessionary environments have made homebuyers less of a rush to close deals. \\n\\nMany experts in the mortgage industry see rates going down especially with the government preventing a US debt default. As the banking sector calms down. Economic data points towards a strong economy, and inflation eases, rates hopefully will go downward through the end of 2023. Fed tightening may put some upward pressure on mortgage rates in the near term, but ultimately more certainty about the Fed’s actions will help to smooth out some of the volatility we have seen with mortgage rates. It is likely that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates for the tenth consecutive time in May, which may represent the peak for the current round of policy tightening. Also if inflation surprises to the downside or recession fears intensify, mortgage rates could fall.\\n\\n**Risks/The Dirty: Why this Stock has fallen 90% from its peak.** \\n\\nReal Estate market got fucked worse than an episode of Brazzers. Interest rates got hiked worse than Johnny Sins morning wood and a recession made people less likely to move. This combination wrecked REITs, brokerages, growth stocks, every autists portfolios, even those losers in r/dividends with their measly .69 cents quarterly payments. \\n\\nRisks include \\n\\n* Interest Rates\\n* Financial Health (They need to crank out some earnings, they are using preferred stock, stock based comp, and senior notes to get through rough times)\\n* Housing Market (Back to interest rates, houses need to be being bought.)\\n\\nThe good news is, I see that the stock has been wrecked by the risks above. And as the light at the end of tunnel gets closer the stock should derisk itself assuming real estate armageddon does not hit and the stock price should go up. I do not think it will get anywhere near the former all time high stock price in the next couple years, but think it will bring great gains that outpace the general market. \\n\\n**Future Outlook from Q1 2023 Earnings:**\\n\\n* Reduced staff and made organizational changes, making support staff ratios to agents better\\n* Focused on mortgage cross selling business, concierge services, expanding Redfin Preimer Nationwide\\n* Exited the home buying business that again, fucked earnings like a scene out of brazzers. \\n* Aim to return to the traditional broker model, increasing monetization.\\n* Projected real Estate Service back to growth in Q2 2023 and strong double digit growth in rental and mortgage businesses. \\n* They expected adjusted EBITDA to be breakeven or better for 2023, $190 million better than 2022.\\n\\n**Valuation Notes:**\\n\\nThe stock has been hammered…look at the stock chart. A lot of worst case nightmare scenarios came true for RDFN. Now RDFN is not a real estate company or REIT, it is a brokerage but also a tech stock. One of the biggest surprises when analyzing RDFN is their price to sales ratio. \\n\\nRDFN has a P/S ratio of .51 which is incredibly low and before covid traded anywhere from 1.25 to 1.8 regularly. Because the company is not currently profitable it is a great ratio to do a quick comp. Meanwhile stocks like PLTR have a 14.6x P/S ratio. I know they aren’t the same company or growth or macro factors. But as this stock continues to have a great 2023 and market cap grows, more and more institutional investors will enter this heavily cyclical stock that has the most to gain in a great economic cycle. \\n\\nAs revenues rebound and grow, hopefully becoming profitable, see no reason this stock cannot hit over $30 in 30 months. \\n\\n**Conclusion:** \\n\\nGood stock. Fucked from tough times past 2 years. Innovative product that actually provides value at much more of a discount then some 6% sucking vampire real estate agent. Buy for tendies. I like it as interest rates go down, house buying environment picks back up, continued expansion, and better margins. Hopefully the worst is behind us and as earnings grow and the stock derisks, stock price will spike. \\n\\n**Positions:**\\n\\n1600 Shares at $10.16, looking to add more. And looking to add leaps for 2024/2025.\"}, {'text': 'As I flip through reports that I can find from various investment firm, one thing I realize is that most of them are somewhat bearish and yet no one is selling. \"We stay invested but cautious as a result\" is the common theme.

Bank of America (BoA) card data indicated a larger decrease in travel spending compared to the previous month. However, April\\'s core retail sales (excluding automobiles and gas) were higher than expected, driven by restaurant and online purchases. BAC credit and debit card data revealed that consumers have been trading down and spending more at value grocery stores to cope with inflation. Overall, consumers\\' financial health remains strong, but delinquency rates increased in Q1. The frequency of CEOs mentioning \"inflation\" during earnings calls reached a one-and-a-half-year low. Most Fed members who spoke this week had a hawkish stance, increasing the probability of a June interest rate hike to over 40% on Thursday. However, the market was calmed by remarks from JP, bringing the probability back down to 20% on Friday.\\n\\n[Inflation data summary this week](https://preview.redd.it/qcm1kk49831b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef57f917f6aac730f99b74429a2e3c9844643707)\\n\\n[Summary from previous weeks](https://preview.redd.it/keifgd6c831b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cc6194c8b1164e5666411c4c3991b95d7b3ff60)\\n\\n[Personal spending still on a downward trend](https://preview.redd.it/4539t3m7831b1.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ffcf4d57bfcba1f74d61a1e4e3006531b549322)\\n\\n**The Leading Economic Index (LEI) reached a new low, but industrial output rebounded more than expected. The GDPNow model predicts a 2.9% growth for Q2, indicating no sign of a recession yet.** Economic data this week showed mixed results. Although the LEI dropped in April, the decline was smaller than the previous month. The overall the indicator still pointed to a mild recession in Q3. The housing market, including homebuilder sentiment, starts, permits, sales, and prices, appears to have stabilized, which is a positive sign for the economy. US industrial production unexpectedly increased in April, particularly in auto production, which is a strong economic signal and could potentially address the issue of record low inventory nationwide. The US job market remains healthy and tight, with jobless claims lower than estimated last week. Global economic growth remains sluggish, with both EU and Chinese industrial output falling short of expectations.\\n\\n[Summary of economic data](https://preview.redd.it/royqlirv831b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=95c90f20c4197122266cdf645bde8430f102e643)\\n\\nUS business and markets: The number of companies mentioning \"recession\" during earnings calls has reached a one-year low. In Q1 earnings calls, 107 companies cited \"recession,\" which is higher than the 5-year average of 77 and the 10-year average of 59. However, this number has declined for the third consecutive quarter after peaking in Q2 2022. In terms of sectors, information technology and healthcare seem to be the least concerned about a recession. There has been increased discussion about the debt ceiling, but the stock market has remained relatively stable without much volatility. The bond market experienced a significant sell-off, leading to the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond reaching its highest level in over two months. This sell-off is likely due to hawkish talks from the Federal Reserve rather than concerns about the debt ceiling.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pw72n6u5931b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dfa04a34ffe8016d31f608ad6d24c160ef8b9ff\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5gi1sfi6931b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=beb1cdb42388352a4c060c342f01895f3a473cba\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yci17vz6931b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=0258fbfdc30086490ca33929a895ab92515bc22e\\n\\nThe S&P 500 posted a 1.6% gain for the week, breaking free from a narrow range it had been stuck in since April. Mega-cap stocks once again outperformed their value counterparts, maintaining growth equity\\'s strong performance this year. Earnings reports from major consumer-related companies painted a gloomy picture of consumer spending. Both Home Depot and Target provided full-year guidance below market expectations. However, Walmart provided a silver lining as it benefited from consumer trade-downs. The company cited gains in groceries and increased store visits from budget-conscious affluent consumers. During economic downturns, weak household consumption often stems from consumers reducing their debt levels. However, debt payment levels today remain well below historical averages, suggesting that while household consumption may slow, a significant contraction is not expected in the near future. As consumer spending is 70% of GDP, a deep recession is still unlikely.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1t39zywn931b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=9341bb2715fcfee803c929b202238b48b2de8a98\\n\\n# My positions and predictions\\n\\n**US Equity Valuation**\\n\\nAnalysts’ estimations:\\n\\n2023 Full Year EPS: $220 (down from $221 last week)\\n\\nNTM EPS: $230 (unchanged from last week)\\n\\n2024 Full Year EPS: $246 (down from $247 last week)\\n\\nCurrent forward PE: 18.3 (up from 18.0 last week), lower than 5-year average of 18.5 and higher than 10-year average of 17.3. \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oqdwnvhs931b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc0c30bd1ee3b116039abcd6dd01fca986bb5f4b\\n\\nMy investment thesis has not changed.

One of Nike\\'s most iconic and influential product lines is the Air Jordan shoes, which hold immense cultural and historical significance.\\n\\nThe Air Jordan brand, closely associated with basketball legend Michael Jordan, has revolutionized the sneaker culture and achieved unparalleled success. These shoes not only offer exceptional performance and innovative design but also serve as a fashion statement and collector\\'s item. The enduring popularity of Air Jordan shoes is a testament to their iconic status and their ability to transcend sports and appeal to a wide audience.\\n\\nThe partnership between Nike and Michael Jordan, which began in 1984, marked a turning point in the sneaker industry. The Air Jordan line introduced groundbreaking designs, including the famous \"Jumpman\" logo, and created a global phenomenon that resonates with athletes, sneaker enthusiasts, and fashion-conscious individuals alike.\\n\\nThe success of Air Jordan shoes not only reflects their historical significance but also suggests a positive outlook for future sales. Nike\\'s ability to generate excitement and anticipation surrounding new Air Jordan releases has consistently fueled demand and led to rapid sell-outs. Limited-edition models, collaborations with renowned designers, and strategic marketing campaigns further contribute to the exclusivity and desirability of Air Jordan shoes. This combination of factors positions the brand for continued growth and expansion in the future.\\n\\n#.\\n\\nAI: Nike has been actively incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into its business operations to drive growth, enhance customer experience, and optimize sales. Here are some key areas where Nike is leveraging\\n\\n1. Consumer Insights and Personalization:\\nNike has been increasing its use of AI algorithms to analyze vast amounts of customer data, including purchase history, browsing behavior, and social media interactions, to gain valuable consumer insights. This data-driven approach enables Nike to personalize marketing messages, product recommendations, and offers, tailoring them to individual customer preferences. By delivering personalized experiences, Nike aims to deepen customer engagement, foster brand loyalty, and drive sales.\\n\\n2. Product Design and Development:\\nAI now plays a crucial role in Nike\\'s product design and development process. The company uses AI-powered software tools to streamline and enhance design processes, enabling faster prototyping and iteration. AI algorithms can analyze consumer trends, market demand, and performance data to identify opportunities for innovation and inform product development decisions. This approach allows Nike to create products that align with customer needs and preferences, reducing time to market and increasing the chances of success.\\n\\n\\n#.\\n\\nNike\\'s partnerships and sponsorships with major sports stars significantly contribute to its success and brand recognition. Collaborations with athletes such as LeBron James, Cristiano Ronaldo, Serena Williams, and numerous others enhance Nike\\'s visibility and credibility in the sports industry. These partnerships not only serve as powerful marketing tools but also provide opportunities for co-branded product lines, unique collaborations, and innovative campaigns that resonate with consumers on a personal level. By associating its products with these iconic athletes, Nike strengthens its position as a leader in the athletic footwear and apparel market.\\n\\nFurthermore, Nike\\'s commitment to innovation and technological advancements plays a pivotal role in its continued success. The company invests heavily in research and development to deliver cutting-edge products that offer superior performance and comfort. Nike\\'s proprietary technologies, including Flyknit, React foam cushioning, and Air Zoom, provide athletes with a competitive edge and set the brand apart from its competitors. This emphasis on innovation ensures that Nike remains at the forefront of the industry, attracting consumers who prioritize quality, performance, and style.\\n\\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, several positive signals can be observed in Nike\\'s stock chart. The stock has demonstrated a consistent upward trend over time, indicating a steady and consistent increase in value. Strong support and resistance levels have formed, suggesting a stable price floor and potential for further price appreciation.\\n\\nAdditionally, the stock has exhibited bounces off moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, further reinforcing the bullish sentiment. These moving averages act as dynamic support levels, indicating that investors have consistently viewed price dips as buying opportunities. Moreover, volume surges during upward price movements suggest strong buying interest and investor confidence in the company\\'s prospects.\\n\\nTechnical indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) can also be considered. The MACD line remaining consistently above the signal line indicates a bullish bias, suggesting that positive momentum is in favor of the stock. Furthermore, the MACD histogram displaying positive values reinforces the notion of upward momentum and potential further price appreciation.\\n\\nIn addition to the positive technical indicators mentioned earlier, another significant development in Nike\\'s stock chart is the formation of a bullish chart pattern, such as an ascending triangle or a cup and handle pattern. These patterns often indicate a period of consolidation followed by a potential breakout to the upside, suggesting the possibility of further price gains in the future.\\n\\nFurthermore, Nike\\'s strong financial performance and consistent revenue growth provide additional support for its positive outlook. The company has a proven track record of delivering solid financial results, demonstrating its ability to navigate through various market conditions successfully. Nike\\'s robust sales figures, driven by both online and offline channels, underscore its strong brand appeal and customer loyalty.\\n\\nMoreover, Nike\\'s strategic investments in advertising and marketing have played a crucial role in elevating its brand image and expanding its customer base. The company\\'s innovative and captivating ad campaigns, featuring both renowned athletes and inspiring narratives, resonate with consumers worldwide. Nike\\'s ability to connect with its target audience on an emotional level has solidified its position as a cultural icon and contributed to its continued success.\\n\\nAnother notable aspect of Nike\\'s business strategy is its focus on sustainability and corporate responsibility. The company has made significant efforts to reduce its environmental footprint and promote ethical practices throughout its supply chain. Nike\\'s commitment to sustainability not only aligns with the growing consumer demand for eco-friendly products but also positions the company as a responsible corporate citizen, enhancing its reputation and attracting socially conscious consumers.\\n\\nAdditionally, Nike\\'s strong global presence and expanding market reach provide a solid foundation for future growth. The company\\'s international operations, particularly in emerging markets, present significant opportunities for revenue expansion. As disposable incomes rise and consumer preferences continue to shift toward athleisure and sportswear, Nike is well-positioned to capture market share and drive sales growth in these regions.\\n\\nOne key aspect that supports the notion of Nike not being overpriced is its valuation relative to its industry peers. When comparing Nike\\'s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to other companies in the apparel and footwear industry, it is apparent that Nike\\'s valuation remains reasonable. This suggests that investors are willing to pay a fair price for the company\\'s earnings potential and growth prospects. Furthermore, Nike\\'s P/E ratio has historically traded at a premium compared to its competitors, indicating market confidence in the company\\'s ability to deliver strong financial performance.\\n\\nNike\\'s dominant position within the industry is another crucial factor contributing to its positive outlook. The company has established itself as a market leader, capturing a significant share of the global athletic footwear and apparel market. Its strong brand recognition and reputation for quality and innovation have allowed Nike to maintain a competitive edge over its rivals. The company\\'s extensive distribution network, encompassing both physical stores and e-commerce platforms, further solidifies its market dominance.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that Nike\\'s dominance in the industry is not solely based on its historical success but also on its ability to adapt to changing consumer trends. The company has demonstrated its agility and forward-thinking approach by embracing technology and digitalization. Nike\\'s investment in digital platforms, such as its Nike App and SNKRS app, has facilitated direct engagement with consumers, enabling personalized shopping experiences and fostering brand loyalty.\\n\\nMoreover, Nike\\'s recent foray into the direct-to-consumer (DTC) model has proven successful. By focusing on selling products directly to customers through its own channels, including online platforms and Nike-owned stores, the company has gained greater control over its brand image, customer relationships, and profit margins. This shift toward a DTC strategy not only enhances Nike\\'s competitive advantage but also positions it to capitalize on the growing e-commerce trend and consumer preference for seamless shopping experiences.\\n\\nIn terms of potential upside, Nike\\'s recent expansion into new markets and product categories presents significant growth opportunities. The company has been actively targeting emerging markets, such as China and India, where rising disposable incomes and a growing middle class have fueled demand for sportswear. By tailoring its marketing strategies and product offerings to local preferences, Nike has successfully gained market share in these regions, with ample room for further penetration.\\n\\nFurthermore, Nike\\'s diversification beyond footwear into apparel, accessories, and digital fitness platforms has expanded its revenue streams and customer reach. The company\\'s ability to leverage its brand equity and cross-sell products to its existing customer base enhances its growth potential and creates additional avenues for revenue generation.\\n\\n- \\n-\\n\\nNegative Factors:\\nCompetitive Landscape: Nike operates in a highly competitive industry, facing challenges from other athletic footwear and apparel brands. Competitors may introduce innovative products or implement aggressive marketing strategies, posing a threat to Nike\\'s market share.\\n\\nNike has a well-established brand with a loyal customer base, strong product portfolio, and robust marketing capabilities. The company\\'s ability to innovate, respond to market trends, and maintain strong relationships with athletes and influencers positions it favorably to mitigate competitive challenges.\\n\\nSales Growth and Investments in Advertising:\\nNike\\'s sales growth and investments in advertising have been crucial drivers of its success. However, potential negative factors should be considered.\\nNegative Factors:\\n\\n Economic Conditions: Economic downturns or recessions can impact consumer spending habits, leading to reduced discretionary spending on athletic footwear and apparel.\\n\\nWhile economic conditions can influence consumer behavior, Nike\\'s strong brand loyalty and global market presence provide a degree of resilience. Moreover, the company\\'s diverse product offerings cater to different consumer segments and price points, reducing vulnerability to economic fluctuations.\\n\\nSignificance of Air Jordan Shoes:\\nThe Air Jordan brand holds significant value within Nike\\'s portfolio, contributing to its overall brand strength. However, potential challenges exist that could affect the brand\\'s performance.\\nNegative Factors:\\nChanging Fashion Trends: Consumer preferences and fashion trends evolve over time, which may impact the desirability and demand for Air Jordan shoes.\\n\\nNike has a long history of adapting to changing trends and consumer preferences. The company\\'s focus on innovation, collaborations, and limited-edition releases helps maintain the appeal and exclusivity of Air Jordan shoes. Additionally, the loyal following and emotional connection associated with the brand are likely to provide continued support.\\n\\nPartnerships with Major Sports Stars:\\nNike\\'s partnerships with major sports stars have been instrumental in building its brand image and expanding its reach. However, certain risks should be considered.\\n\\n#\\n Reputation Risks: Any negative publicity or controversies involving endorsed athletes could potentially impact Nike\\'s brand perception.\\n\\nWhile reputation risks exist, Nike has a well-established process for selecting and managing its partnerships. The company prioritizes athletes who align with its values and have a positive influence on consumers. Moreover, Nike\\'s extensive portfolio of athletes allows it to diversify and mitigate risks associated with individual endorsements.\\n\\nCounterfeit and Imitation Shoes:\\nNegative Factor:\\nCounterfeit and imitation shoes pose a risk to Nike\\'s brand reputation and market share. The availability of cheaper alternatives could potentially attract price-sensitive consumers away from authentic Nike products.\\n\\nPersonally i know many people who have tried to buy counterfeits. They have all told me its more expensive than you think, and extremely complicated to do. You need to pay a third party chinese person just to ship the goods for you and it gets very complicated and expensive. Medium-to-large orders and imitations of expensive shoes are at risk of being seized by customs. Damage to brand reputation remains a real risk.\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion:\\nWhile Nike faces potential challenges and negative factors, its positive outlook and growth potential remain strong. The company\\'s ability to adapt to competitive landscapes, maintain brand loyalty, innovate in response to changing trends, and manage partnerships positions it favorably for continued success. While no investment is without risks, Nike\\'s steady and consistent upward stock price, sales growth, and dominance in the industry suggest that it will continue to consistently provide positive returns to investors in accordance with its past, consistent results.\\n\\n\\nLISTEN UP APES: decisions should be based on thorough research, analysis of individual risk tolerance, and if possible a consultation with a financial advisor.

It does not feel like a 2008-type of crisis, but it feels like stress in some parts of the financial sector. The effect of banking stress is not small; we need to take it into account and 'sit and watch' it. We are trying to figure out where we are in the business cycle when this cycle looks like no other.

This was the smallest annual increase since April 2021 and the 10th straight month of improvement since inflation peaked in June of last year at 9.1%. Core inflation ticked down to 5.5% from 5.6%. While core inflation simply met expectations, the price increase was partly driven by a spike in used car prices. However, wholesale used car price dropped in April, so this decline may be reflected in retail price in May or June. Housing likely to decline as well given Fed’s lagging statistic method. What’s even more encouraging is the core services inflation excluding shelter (the so called “super core” which is largely a function of the labor market), improved meaningfully, rising by the slowest pace in nine months. Labor market, even though still very tight, showed sign of weakness as initial jobless claim jumped to a 1-year high. Below is the summary from this week’s news.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qev76jh0duza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d83bf89d6b4c5bde31b7cd8525a8a038590b9d5\\n\\n[Summary from previous weeks](https://preview.redd.it/c4632qn1duza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=8349e33504726de42550aeb41951be88accbf466)\\n\\n[Now that Fed rate is officially higher than CPI, a pause is reasonable](https://preview.redd.it/5e0pl809duza1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=eab2832fd56fbfe8169efa4679f66de3c25b9ea9)\\n\\n**Both lending condition and demand deteriorated, and small business sentiment dropped to a new low.** SLOOS report released on Monday showed an incrementally tighter lending condition vs. Jan survey. However, loan demand also declined, especially in the CRE sector where buyer had the worst contraction in CRE loan demand in recent years. The reason for low loan demand included hard to get funding, cost of funding is high, low confidence in the economy (no interest in expanding or buying large assets). If credit condition tightening continues, it could be a recipe for recession, however, recent data showed lending actually improved in both large and small banks. Regional bank also suggested that they will continue to expand credit this year in their earnings calls. Plus, if loan demand is so low, losing some deposit might not be a bad thing (or even desired) as cash deposit is a liability for banks.  So what’s concerning is not lending standard but rather loan demand, which a net 55.6% of domestic banks reported declining C&I loan demand from large and medium-sized businesses, comparable to the levels we last saw during the GFC.\\n\\n[Historically, when lending condition tightens sharply, hard landing follows](https://preview.redd.it/93650phgduza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9f332ab782d16e350867f2eb8e94e75bf24e10d)\\n\\n[Bank lending has been growing for the last few weeks for both large and small banks](https://preview.redd.it/injgs0ynduza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddd3b74c80272fbd67705d30036c593b41eb40c4)\\n\\nSmall business optimism index hit a new low in almost 2 decades mostly due to soft measures (expectations) such as expected sales and earnings as well as inventory; hard measures (current condition) on the other hand is still steady such as current job opening and credit condition.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7n0m2c6euza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=08cbe26daf583e2549a3527d24a37f01c9446a83\\n\\n**Q1 earnings beat analysts’ expectation however companies experienced smaller-than-average price increases.** With 92% of S&P 500 companies having reported first-quarter results as of Friday, the proportion of S&P 500 companies that have beaten analysts’ earnings expectations remained slightly higher than usual. So far, 78% of companies have exceeded net income expectations, topping the 10-year average of 73%. On the other hand, companies reporting negative surprises faced larger price declines than usual. Overall, 46% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported a positive EPS surprise for Q1 have seen a decrease in price two days before the earnings release through two days after the earnings release while companies that have reported negative EPS surprises have seen a larger price decrease than average (4.1% vs. 2.2%). This market response cannot be solely attributed to the earnings outlook for the second quarter of 2023, as companies providing guidance have been less negative compared to previous averages. About 57% of S&P 500 companies issued negative guidance for Q2 2023, below historical averages. \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5dzrv939euza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=756e0e1835230d9dea37b24e6044be5101a2f324\\n\\n**Regional bank issue persists and could get worse.** The acquisition of First Republic Bank\\'s assets by JPMorgan Chase did not improve the performance of U.S. bank equities. Since the deal was announced on May 1, the S&P 500 Regional Banks Index has declined by almost six percent. Hedge funds, concerned about First Republic\\'s issues and the lack of temporary deposit guarantees by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, have been searching for other regional banks that may face similar problems. This has led to short selling and added pressure on bank stocks, particularly those vulnerable to deposit outflows. Additionally, the tightening of lending standards by banks due to weak economic trends has compounded the challenges. Although federal financial authorities have the means to address potential issues, negative news about specific regional banks is likely to continue weighing on bank stocks and could impact broader market indexes like the S&P 500.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qogc46feeuza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=22170ca9ca98cca39934e36c39523e521003e6ef\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b75o6l0feuza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=252689249442d1cf137250ae8b0035c598731024\\n\\n**The debt ceiling drama could get out of hands.** I still don’t believe US will default (never happened before), but that doesn’t mean the debt ceiling drama won’t create any volatility in the market. According to a study by RBC Capital Markets, the impact of debt ceiling deadlines on the S&P 500 varies based on market conditions and political factors. During calm periods with low volatility and minimal political risks, S&P 500 declines related to debt ceiling deadlines were modest, ranging from 2% to 7%. However, when the market was already anxious due to economic concerns and there was heightened political drama surrounding the debt ceiling, the market struggled, leading to declines of 10 percent to 19 percent. The most severe instance occurred in 2011, when the S&P 500 dropped 19 percent during a political clash in Washington over the debt ceiling. This nearly resulted in a crisis and the downgrading of the U.S. credit rating, compounded by fears related to the European sovereign debt crisis. I would say today’s market condition is getting closer and closer to a bad scenario.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbzyjioieuza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebc26ae4298b427957b82d780d1a2d4d0dc04cf3\\n\\n# My positions and predictions\\n\\n**US Equity Valuation**\\n\\nAfter this week’s earnings reports, 2023 SP500 EPS estimation unchanged last week:\\n\\n2023 Full Year EPS: $221\\n\\nNTM: $230 ($2 increase from last week)\\n\\n2024 Full Year EPS: $247\\n\\nCurrent forward PE 18.0, lower than 5-year average of 18.5 and higher than 10-year average of 17.3.

Q1 earnings have largely beaten expectations; however, overall, S&P 500 earnings are still 4.5% lower than Q1 of last year. Currently, analysts\\' estimate for 2023 full-year earnings remains the same or slightly higher than last year, primarily due to an anticipated 10% year-over-year earnings growth in Q4. In my opinion, this projection is overly optimistic. How can we expect a 10% earnings growth when inflation is only estimated to be 3.5%, while we are experiencing negative growth with inflation at 6-7%? This simply doesn\\'t make any sense to me. I am still incorporating analysts\\' estimations into my model, but when I say we are priced for perfection, you can understand what I mean. Some analysts share my view, and below is an earnings estimation from PIMCO.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ulffv16fuza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=008214475a1ac474746b2b5c9c29025b29dff733\\n\\n**My year-end projection (not changed):**\\n\\nMy base case (shown in green) has not changed from last week. Assume SP500 earnings of $247 for 2024, with inflation stabilizing under 4% and continuing to decline. The Fed pause after May hike and keep rate unchanged until year-end, before starting to cut in 2024. Year-end target is between 3920 to 4410 for SP500 based on 16-18X forward PE ratio.\\n\\nLight blue box is where we are today. If we use 10-yr average forward PE ratio (17X), 3900 is a more appropriate level, and if we use risk premium model, we should be close to 3600.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bk2yim68fuza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e01bb5eed7cde9fa892936619751f067f9fdcb7\\n\\nIf the current \"Goldilocks\" situation persists, characterized by a resilient economy and consumers, along with inflation reaching 3% by year-end, small- and mid-cap stocks, particularly those in the Small /Mid Growth style, could present an interesting investment opportunity.

VIX is being suppressed artificially. I have covered how in previous posts. Simplest way to know is to look at HYG. It normally correlates. Not anymore.\\n2. Oil is also being suppressed. Again, if oil rises, everything else rises in price. The Fed does not want inflation. Best way to fight inflation is to keep oil down. I\\'ve shared how they are doing this in previous posts. (links at the end)\\n3. The Japanese are the major fbuddy helping the Fed do all of this.\\n\\nI have to tell you that in +30 years in the market managing assets, I have not seen a market like this before. It is unnatural and controlled. That\\'s why the VIX keeps dropping when risk keeps rising. I have posted at great length about the outlier risks that currently exist (Ukraine, banks, etc.) so no need to get into that again.\\n\\n# WHY IS IT DIFFERENT NOW?\\n\\nSo a couple of things have happened and a couple are scheduled to happen that have caused me to go out on a limb and say this: what the Fed can control is limited and the end is near. Yes, the Fed can print money ad infinitum, like they have been doing, and the Japanese can play their role, but at some point, outside events will occur that they cannot control. Even with the help of the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon and JPM.\\n\\nHere is what has happened recently:\\n\\n# TRIGGER #1: OIL being manipulated is close to being out of US hands:\\n\\n1.

Why? I think its because they see that they have a shot at gaining more control over their regional politics AND perhaps a chance to wean themselves off of the US dollar dependance.\\n\\nIf the price of oil is allowed to trade freely, its going up. Period. If the price of oil goes up, inflation goes up.\\n\\n# RESULT: If oil goes up, inflation goes up, and then the Fed will truly lose control.\\n\\n# TRIGGER #2: DEBT CEILING TALKS\\n\\nLots of news lately about the debt ceiling. Of course the debt ceiling would not be a problem if the US just spent LESS but thats a moot point since thats not going to happen.

Inflation indicators turned hotter in April with consumer spending leading the way. The US economy showed signs of a rebound in last week\\'s ISM report, while global demand remained soft. The Q1 earnings season is coming to an end with results exceeding expectations. However, things may not be as bright under the hood. Regional and small bank pain may not have ended yet, with deposit outflow and commercial real estate being their biggest risks.\\n\\n# Market-moving News\\n\\n**The Fed hike 25bp and putting pause on the table.** On Wednesday, the Fed hiked another 25bp, marking the tenth consecutive raise and bringing the benchmark rate to 5-5.25%. This decision pleased both bulls and bears, as JP raised the possibility of a pause in June while emphasizing that the decision would depend on data. Inflation remains a priority for JP, and he seemed to be happy with the progress made in disinflation while keeping the job market strong. However, he did express concerns about tightening credit conditions, which we will learn more about in next week\\'s SLOOS report. This week\\'s summary of inflation-related news leans mostly towards a neutral to negative outlook, indicating an increased risk of inflation picking up again.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3okmc85ngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa307490f8ea74e0e0a742f44453e6cdc8984a95\\n\\n**Economic indicators have largely rebounded from previous lows**, with notable improvement seen in the ISM manufacturing report released on Monday. The report indicated a recovery from the low point observed in March and surpassed expectations. However, it is important to note that both prices paid and received have increased, leading to higher inflationary pressures. Global demand remains weak, particularly in the European Union (EU) and China, while domestic economic activity shows signs of picking up pace. The Atlanta Fed has raised its Q2 GDP estimate to 2.7% due to robust consumer spending. Here is a summary of the major economic data from last month, with a focus on the manufacturing sector.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/19eidn16ngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=83e93d531e63aaa8f0fd2196e31f7cdcb78cdde2\\n\\n**Q1 earnings have thus far exceeded expectations, although there have been minimal changes to the full-year estimates**. As of Friday, 85% of companies in the S&P 500 have reported their actual results. Among the reporting companies, 79% have reported actual earnings per share (EPS) above estimates, surpassing the 5-year average of 77% and the 10-year average of 73%. In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 7.0% above estimates, which exceeds the 10-year average of 6.4%. The blended earnings decline for the first quarter stands at -2.2%, which represents an improvement from the -3.7% reported last week and the -6.7% at the end of the first quarter (March 31). However, it is important to note that this marks the second consecutive quarter with a year-over-year decline in earnings. Analysts are projecting a decline of -5.7% in earnings for Q2 2023, followed by growth of 1.2% in Q3 2023 and 8.5% in Q4 2023. For the entire year of 2023, analysts predict earnings growth of 1.2%.\\n\\nHowever, it is worth noting that Q1 earnings were skewed by three companies (AMZN, UBER, TDOC) that had significant losses due to write-downs from acquisitions in the previous year. In Q1 last year, AMZN wrote down 3.8 billion for RIVN, UBER wrote down 5.9 billion for Grab, DiDi, and Aurora, and TDOC wrote down 6.6 billion for Livongo. As these write-downs were removed from their balance sheets in Q1 this year, these companies reported substantial growth in earnings. Excluding these companies, the earnings picture is actually much weaker (though still slightly better than estimated).\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ifrkhs47ngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=45e486ff0c9554aa2618c83ca04da42b11b6b5a4\\n\\n**The regional bank selloff was the major drama of last week, and not without cause.** While the overall stock market remained relatively stable throughout the week, regional banks faced considerable challenges. Some regional bank stocks experienced a drastic decline of over 50% on Thursday, only to rebound on Friday. The roller coaster ride was largely impulse driven. However, there are potential fundamental risks associated with regional and small banks.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with the good news. Fed H8 (assets and liabilities of commercial banks) report was released on Friday. Notably, there continues to be a \"walk\" of deposits from both large and small commercial banks. However, the outflow observed during the week was smaller than the previous week, and the outflow from small banks did not surpass that of large banks (no deposit transfers from small banks to large banks like March).\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wpiyiaj8ngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca9813f05dbbd471a51e007436954b544f27953\\n\\nAnd what\\'s more encouraging is that both large and small banks experienced accelerated loan growth compared to the previous week, particularly small banks, which exhibited the fastest year-to-date expansion in loans. This credit expansion typically signifies confidence from these banks and suggests they may perceive greater stability in the sector and the overall economy (although this is before the selloff on Thursday).\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pxizhd9ngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=cda1427aec6b771856d4ac17bb987cfd29cffe90\\n\\nFrom the Fed\\'s perspective, I do not believe they would allow any bank to default and depositors to lose their savings. While the Fed may not care much about small banks, maintaining public confidence in the overall banking sector is crucial. The Fed possesses the authority (via the ability to initiate monetary expansion) and the determination (as demonstrated by the swift bailout of SVB in just two days) to promptly address any potential systemic risks. However, this does not necessarily mean these banks will survive. Currently, there are two risks that should not be overlooked.\\n\\n1. The risk of deposit outflows and a potential bank run is a significant concern. Fear and panic can often outweigh rationality in such situations. As long as people have alternatives and no compelling reason to bank with these small institutions, there is a diminishing incentive for them to deposit funds. This could lead to a gradual erosion of deposits or even a sudden bank run. I simply cannot see how the situation can be reversed in the short term.\\n2. Another major risk for small banks lies in their exposure to commercial real estate (CRE). In addition to potential losses on bonds and debt securities, these banks have a substantial portion of their loan portfolio tied up in CRE loans. As the value of commercial properties declines rapidly, the collateral backing these loans becomes weaker, posing a significant threat to the stability and financial health of these institutions.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdc2zrmangya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=af89925be2383fea499e0270b294f5a38b8dbb5f\\n\\nThere are types of CRE loans, but the most significant issue arises from office loans. With the increasing number of individuals working remotely, the vacancy rates for office spaces in the United States have been rising and reached a new high in the first quarter.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i9chnp1cngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fc6637c3449ae535e5781e1ec47d3d47ffe0fa9\\n\\nAs a result, these office properties are experiencing a rapid decline in value. Office buildings have already witnessed a 7% decrease in valuation since last year, and forecasts suggest that they could potentially lose up to 30% in value before reaching the bottom.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hawmw6vcngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=e05cd6c07b401042d76ff436fcfe43f1c7aefab6\\n\\nMeanwhile, there is a pressing issue regarding the refinancing of approximately $700 billion in mortgages on office buildings this year. These loans will need to be refinanced at significantly higher rates compared to when they were initially originated, further complicated by the decreased property values. The consequences of tighter credit conditions and diminishing rental income have already started to emerge. The delinquency rate on office loans has been rising since the beginning of the year, contrasting with the relatively stable delinquency rates observed in other CRE loans.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j08op2qdngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bf89d2b1776bc89c566b5c40659fa82e8daa82f\\n\\nThe financing rates on subprime commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) have been experiencing a substantial increase since March.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fady5ndengya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=90c8d5e52fa8bb8da5ec2db9806186c8625d3ec3\\n\\nThe concerns surrounding the office sector are undeniably reflected in the year-to-date (YTD) performance of office real estate investment trusts (REITs).\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ux2xq2fngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=f68ff9c7f48f8b2a01bb9d211f944ea976837233\\n\\nIn terms of bank exposures, Wells Fargo & Co. holds the largest office exposure among banks, with a total of $36.14 billion as of year-end 2022. However, this exposure represents only 3.8% of their gross loans.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oqtiuj5gngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=06bac084d3c7b70af65fa5d399c418e0fbf67fab\\n\\nWhich small banks has the biggest exposure to CRE loans? You guessed it:  New York Community Bancorp. (NYCB), which recently bought the assets of Silicon Valley Bank, has CRE loan exposure to the tune of 71% of its entire loan book. Other notable names on the list include EastWest Bancorp. (EWBC) with 39%, PacWest Bancorp. (PACW) and Western Alliance (WAL) with 28% and some other names which shall not be mentioned on this board.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the overall banking sector may not currently face systemic risk, certain small and regional banks could face significant challenges due to deposit outflows and potential defaults in the CRE (especially office) loans.\\n\\n# My positions and predictions\\n\\n**US Equity**\\n\\n*Valuation*\\n\\nAfter this week’s earnings reports, 2023 SP500 EPS estimation unchanged last week:\\n\\n2023 Full Year EPS: $221\\n\\nNTM: $230 ($2 increase from last week)\\n\\n2024 Full Year EPS: $247\\n\\nCurrent forward PE 18.0, lower than 5-year average of 18.5 and higher than 10-year average of 17.3.

Assuming the next twelve months (NTM) earnings per share (EPS) is $230 and the projected EPS for 2024 is $247, we can estimate that the S&P 500 index should be at 3542 today and 3804 by year-end (might be higher since the yield on Treasury bills is probably lower at year-end).\\n\\n*Headwinds and tailwinds based on this week’s data*\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqw7qkpjngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=a70443b854ab339a8aec3f474f48efceb1887a9e\\n\\n*My year-end projection:*\\n\\nMy base case (shown in green) has not changed from last week. Assume SP500 earnings of $247 for 2024, with inflation stabilizing under 4% and continuing to decline. The Fed will pause after May hike and keep rate unchanged until year-end, before starting to cut in 2024. Year-end target is between 3920 to 4410 for SP500 based on 16-18X forward PE ratio.\\n\\nLight blue box is where we are today. If we use 10-yr average forward PE ratio (17X), 3900 is a more appropriate level, and if we use risk premium model, we should be close to 3600.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/284du8pkngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=400444f6f22ae4f947e6d91a87a574c56680ed3b\\n\\nIf the current \"Goldilocks\" situation persists, characterized by a resilient economy and consumers, along with inflation reaching 3% by year-end, small-cap stocks, particularly those in the Small Growth style, could present an interesting investment opportunity.

A nice surprise is core PCE ex-housing was only up by 0.24%, lowest in since summer last year. Another welcoming development was the uptick of personal saving rate from 4.8% in March to 5.1% in April indicating consumer spending continued to cool. And even better news came from Europe where German CPI lowered more than expectation. But the triumph of disinflation was at the price of slow economic growth with US GDP growing at 1.1% (2% estimated) and Eurozone growing at 0.1% (0.2% estimated). The bond market rallied (yield dropped) in concern of global economic outlook and 10-yr T-bill was down 3.3% for the week (BoJ’s decision of keeping its yield curve control policy also contributed to the rally).\\n\\nAs a result, the summary of this week’s inflation related news is mostly positive.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75wmtj5t94xa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=900cfe013a99bf590b16582a69cc2f7d8e1645a6\\n\\n***2.\\tThis week’s economic indicators were a mixed bag again, with some showing improvement while others dropping to new lows.*** Another week of mixed data, we are seeing signs of recovery and bounce back from previous lows but certainly not out of the woods yet. On the global front, there were a lot of uncertainty too, with Austria’ April PMI declined further from last month and China’s April PMI unexpectedly fall into contraction again, especially export fall by 2.8% indicating poor foreign demand in April. Here is the summary of major economic data from this week (Focused on the manufacturing side):\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/th2z223w94xa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=db9262c588879547c98236e37463b3164d204fe5\\n\\nHowever, things are definitely better on the service side. Card spending still very strong in restraints and bars, as well as hotel and other travel. But since service normally lags manufacturing, I won’t put too much weight into it. But here is the bottom line, consumers today are very well positioned financially with the highest amount of cash tucked away and the lowest debt to asset ratio in decades, so the US economy has a very thick cushion even if things are continued to deteriorate from here.\\n\\n***3.\\tEarnings last week were quite a pleasant surprise, but in the end, they didn't move the full-year estimation much.*** We are not at the mid-point of the earnings season. S&P 500 companies are reporting their best performance relative to analyst expectations since Q4 2021, with 79% of companies reporting Q1 2023 actual EPS above estimates. In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 6.9% above estimates, while the blended earnings decline for Q1 2023 is -3.7%. In terms of revenues, 74% of S&P 500 companies have reported actual revenues above estimates, and companies are reporting revenues that are 2.1% above estimates. The blended revenue growth rate for Q1 2023 is 2.9%. Looking ahead, analysts are projecting earnings growth for the second half of 2023, with earnings growth of 1.2% predicted for CY 2023 (from 219 to 221). My personal take is earnings are much more impactful to individual stock than overall market. For SP500, no earnings surprises will move the estimations much whereas the EPS multiples is the most important factor to determine where we will land by the end of the year. And multiples are mostly affected by liquidity, bond yield and economic outlooks (more to explain in the next section).\\n\\n**My positions and predictions**\\n\\n***US Equity***\\n\\nValuation\\n\\nAfter this week’s earnings reports, SP500 EPS increased by $1 from last week (see what am I saying? The multiple is the key):\\n\\n2023 Full Year EPS: $221\\n\\nNTM: $228\\n\\n2024 Full Year EPS: $247\\n\\nCurrent forward PE 18.3, lower than 5-year average of 18.5 and higher than 10-year average of 17.3. So, in terms of valuation, we are essentially the same as last week.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u404jrkla4xa1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=16e1977cb4e1098d395ae74138e857a997d6e3fb\\n\\nAnd if you read my weekend post last week, you know my biggest concern is the risk premium:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5posoyina4xa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7aff8ef6bb9392b3ffb6872af8da9a8163b7ee1\\n\\nCurrent SP500 risk premium is at a decade low level, so either bond yield is going to drop significantly, which is unlikely given we are still in a tightening circle; or valuation needs drop significantly. And for valuation to drop, either earnings need to grow significantly, or stock prices has to give. Again, we are in a contracting economic environment, I literally don’t see how forward earning growth and significantly beat estimation (12% yoy) and grow 20% or even 25% yoy. So, the upside of the SP500 is very limited, but down side risk (either a hawkish Fed or deteriorating economy) is still very really and not at all priced into stock price.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gy8j6ruqa4xa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6a12d04e8dd51e4e3e74abd2d8d484a6f44c524\\n\\nUpdated valuation based on risk premium: 10-year average risk premium is around 3-3.5%, so if we use 3% risk premium for valuation, stock today should have a forward PE of 15.4, and given NTM EPS is $228 and 2024 EPS is $247, SPX should be at 3511 today and 3804 by year end (might be higher since T-bill yield is probably lower at year end).\\n\\n***Tailwinds (Inflation continues to go down while the economy stabilizes):*** \\n\\nDisinflation continues: Last week’s PCE data confirmed disinflation trend. With major inflation contributors like housing, consumer spending and commodity price continue to decline, the risk of inflation coming back is small, but we are still far from Fed’s target of 2% and since we still have a very tight labor market, “higher for longer” is still the narrative in play.\\n\\nThe economy is still contracting but showing signs of recovery. Last week's economic data was once again a mixed bag. When looking at leading indicators such as transportation and commodities, we are still contracting instead of expanding. Globally, China's PMI miss is quite surprising, considering they still have loose monetary policy. These trends all point to a cooling economy and inflation, but we need to watch closely as over-cooling could lead to a recession.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/njtb6b36b4xa1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=71405f74d9c9613324ab401a4966afc4fd45c283\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/upb9wa36b4xa1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=43968cd19465fc8cc808353bb757fb2a493aab6c\\n\\nCompanies and consumers are doing great: Q1 earnings was a blast. Companies are financially in great shape and was able to transfer majority of the inflation to consumers so margins, even though lower than last year, was still at the level of 2019, and expected to increase going forward.  CEO outlook ticked up for the first time in Q1 since last year.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7qazfid8b4xa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=aae82f7e51b1203986782498d371f4b67cb74bc4\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1tytit9b4xa1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=9724783bf0914564a15889ed9abb590586a19c35\\n\\nConsumers are sitting on a nice cushion of cash that may last for the next couple of years.

No news on CB policy changes, but this week’s Fed decision is the absolute focus.

It's still drama in the derivative market (CDS), but it's not priced into the stock market.\\n\\nCredit crunch: While everyone was excited about First Republic Bank last week, it was more drama than creating any real damage to the economy. However, if this becomes a trend in small/regional banks, then that's a totally different story. Overall, credit tightening is not significant (see my post on Friday), but it might be affecting small businesses unevenly, a lot more than large corporations.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvlh1d1ob4xa1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=99fab58ea91e86f6990b6f2241eb0bbdd1c68d16\\n\\nAlso, regional banks are heavily exposed to commercial real estate, and with declining occupancy rate and in turn their valuations, they will be dealing with a lot more unrealized loss pretty soon. \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hepmi6j2c4xa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbc0165953c2baa6fb41534cb8819a67ebe88f7a\\n\\n**Valuation model and year-end projection:**\\n\\nI've decided to simplify my projections and focus only on current data, without modeling multiple scenarios (removed bull and bear case). My base case (shown in green) predicts SP500 earnings of $221 for 2023 and $247 for 2024 (consensus), with inflation stabilizing under 4% and continuing to decline. The Fed will likely hike rates in May and keep them unchanged until year-end, before starting to cut them in 2024.\\n\\nThe light blue box represents where we are today.

I am **bearish** as I think the stocks are overvalued, but not because I think we are heading into a recession. I simply think that the EPS multiple at the current price is too high, so there is very limited upside for stocks, but a lot of risks are not priced in. I think a pullback of 5-10% would provide a much better entry point. The best strategy right now is probably theta harvesting, but where is the fun in that? So, I have puts.

The Bank of America believes that the OPEC production cut should bring a small upside risk to inflation and a small downside risk to growth. Even if oil prices remain at current levels, the energy CPI subcomponent of the April CPI report may also decline slightly, as the lagged impact of the previous oil price decline outweighed this Monday's rise.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Another strike against tech giants!

But stuff is just about to kick off and I am going to help explain what is happening and will be happening in the coming weeks and months.\\n\\nFrom the start of this fed cycle, I have been wondering who has been eating losses. Basic financial equation 101 teaches you that the present value of an asset is a function of the discount rate applied to its future cf or coupon rate. When the 10/30 year went from 1.5-2.0% in 2019-2021 to 4-5% this year, this meant the market value of those bonds would have fallen by close to 20-25%.\\n\\nFor example TLT, which is the 30 year teasury ETF, has fallen by about 21% in the LTM.\\n\\nMost people don't understand the bond market in the US is the largest in the world, dwarfing the stock market. It is about twice the size of the stockmarket and is the deepest and most liquid securities market in the world. Within this market, the deepest and most liquid part of the market is made up of US treasuries and mortgage backed agency MBS securities.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nuaouidc91na1.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2253c2fa00b34fffb1c3d835a530a2f063ca266\\n\\nWith the sudden spike up in rates over the last 12-16 months, the mark to market losses of the bond market is probably somewhere to the tune of 4-6 trillion. And I have always been wondering where that was going to show up and blow something up in the financial market. And the answer is in the banks.\\n\\nDon't believe what they tell you, Silicon Valley Bank was a very conservative bank. Out of their \\\\~200 billion in assets, very little (<0.5%) was venture debt lending. As you can see in their Q4 Balance Sheet, they had 15 billion in cash/cash like securities, about 120 billion investment securities and 70 billion in loans.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1txj1mjma1na1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=1545218bb68e66ee4af075437b9fb9f170a36432\\n\\nwithin that 120 billion investment securities, it is almost entirely treasuries and Agency MBS/CMO and CMBS with a touch of muni bonds. You can't build a more conservative book if you tried. As these are all effective government securities as the GSEs are still in conservatorship under the treasury. For years due to Basel III, US banks have been derisking and now most of their balance sheets consists of government or quasi government securites which have almost no default risks.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lsa5410ab1na1.png?width=1383&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4996cc97b23bbf068198fd88faa4c631a1d3a3c\\n\\nNow looking at the loan book, you can see the bulk of it is in global fund banking and investor dependent. Global Fund banking is an extremely safe segment, it consists of largely funding or bridging loans to venture capitalist making transactions. So for example if a VC  wants to invest in company A, but they want to wait 2 months before drawing down from their LPs, they will go to SVB to get a credit line for this purpose. This is an extremely safe business model as Venture/PE Funding is contracted funding and there has been basically no defaults on these types of loans ever in history. Then you have private bank, which consisted of lending to rich people over collateralized through the value of their houses, which is also a pretty safe business model as their asset coverage typically exceeds 150% of the loan value.\\n\\nEven the investor dependent segment is typically very safe book, as they will write loans as simply a bridge when a financing round for the company has already closed, but are still waiting a few months for the all the papers to be signed and the funds to be transfered.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r44w54mdc1na1.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=66d0b5e8df56629b339215eadf3c7c41a6fd9560\\n\\nSo wtf is happening, this is a bank that is holding like 2/3 of its book in government papers and the rest in fairly safe lending. The speculative lending to early tech business represent <0.5% of the book.\\n\\nThe answer is the federal reserve, this guy\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/55mo4dswd1na1.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f1e109a395c4eb8712e6b1cd9b917ea2b86b3c4\\n\\nHe basically fucked over the entire banking sector. Remember that 120 billion in agency backed papers  and treasuries in the investment securities section of SVB , well, most of that is HTM (Hold to Maturnity). Its a bank, get over it, a duration mismatch is expected. But the amplitute of the loss is proportional to the raise in rates due simply how bonds work. In the SVB book, the average maturity is around 6 years. Some simple math point to about a 10% loss in this investment book that hasn't been marked to market, representing about 12 billion in losses. This wiped out all the equity of the bank and some of the  value of the bonds.\\n\\nOverall the Agency papers and treasuries can be sold over the course of the next couple of weeks and depositers will get about 60 cents on the dollar and the remainder will be sold over the next 12-48 months and I expect most depositers to get back close to 90 cents + on the dollar.\\n\\nWell that's great, you might say. NO, IT IS NOT GREAT. BECAUSE SVB was not a bad bank, it was actually a pretty conservative bank. It also wouldn't be insolvent if it wasn't for the fed. What it did suffer from was a unique deposit base that was largely not FDIC insured. Since it was largely catering to start-up companies, most accounts went above the FDIC limit of 250k, as a result, this was simply a bank run similar to during the great depression. It doesn't matter how safe the bank was, if there is a run, you won't survive it. And the uniqueness of start-ups which are most often cash burning and therefore extremely senstivie to the lack of cash just meant they were more flighty depositers. Marry that to the game theory dynamics of the low cost of getting your money out first so you can meet payroll mean't that once it starts, you can't stop it.\\n\\nOk, you ask, what the hell does it all mean for the future. Well, here is the thing. If SVB is underwater, are all the banks are underwater?\\n\\nHere are the assets of JPM, again, for the major banks, JPM has a 3.5 trillion balance sheet, and BOA has a 3 trillion balance sheet. JPM only lists out 641 billion of that 3.5 trillion as trading securities and thus and they reported a loss of \\\\~50 billion or \\\\~8%.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pskuutvch1na1.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbd2fe255159ceca0284c2093bae9ffbf6182420\\n\\nThis is a similar picture with BOA, which lists out trading securites of 300 billion, but there is another 2.7 billion in other assets, of which 1 trillion are longer dated treasuries and agency securities. If we mark to market those losses, there is another 80-100 billion in losses which are not being marked to market.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwn7vmluk1na1.png?width=1775&format=png&auto=webp&s=a593d96bc08e6bf8f25ca66921421307aecedc56\\n\\nAgain, going back to the original thought, someone lost 4-6 trillion through the bond market from fed raising rates. Close to 2 trillion is lost through agency securities with the reminder from treasuries. Unironically, close to 15% of this is lost from the fed itself, due to its own balance sheet of treasuries and agency papers. It looks like around 30% of those agency security losses or about \\\\~600 billion is through the commerical banks. I suspect probably another 300-400 billion though treasuries. So the banking sector has lost about 1 trillion in the past year, of which only maybe 100-200 billion has actually been marked-to-market down as losses.\\n\\nRemember, the size of the losses in Subprime was only about \\\\~100 billion. Now, every 50 bps increase by the fed results in close to that much in losses to the banking sector. So yes, Mr. Powell wil likely blow up the entire banking system.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rc3npwezm1na1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=6679401a95b4c44e6a8d86bd33ffb109b19b7e26\\n\\nEdit 1: Alot of people are pointing out that the deposit base of other banks are signficantly different. Yes 100% agree, but the run on liquidity of a bank can come in two ways. One is on the deposit side (see great depression and SVB), the other way is through the interbank funding market (alas 2008). I will write a part II in the coming days of the drying up of that source of liqudity.\\n\\nEdit 2: Also a lot of people keep pointing to hedging and managing duration risk. This is BS as all the banks have this unrealized loss on their balance sheet, go look.Imagine God telling everyone he is going to destroy your house, now go and try to find insurance on your house for less than the cost of building a new house. And to the smart asses mentioning swaps. Go ahead and try to swap your house for a new house for anything less 0. Now think termites slowly destroying your house over the course of a year instead an earthquake, good luck being the person trying to hedge that. But the most relevant point is that a security that is classified under the HTM category, it cannot have any hedges. So to all the people who think this was a risk management issue, go look at all the other banks, they have not hedged their HTM securties either. To compound this, the fed in 2021 signaled very strongly to market that rates were going to held at zero until 2024, and then pivoted in 12 months, throwing everyone in for a loop. There was no realistic way for any management or risk management team to have handled this. So yes, the blame lies largely with the fed here.\\n\\nEdit 3: on all the people saying the larger banks are so much smarter and know what they are doing. SVB had the most liquid portfolio of any bank out there. They had about 8% of their desposits in cash and about \\\\~45% in GSE/treasuries which is the most liquid instrument out there and can be sold down in a weeks notice. None of the other/largest banks are even close to that. The larger banks have a much lower deposit base like \\\\~25%-30% of their capital base and maybe 10-20% in equity and 50-60% are based in interbank financing (hello 2008). The finiky parts of the larger bank's capital structure aren't deposits, most of these are FDIC insured (but still probably only half or so as the business accounts certaintly aren't), it is the intrabank financing part. You know, the stuff that blew up lehman and bear sterns.\\n\\nAlso people don't seem grasp what a bank is and think they should be 100% in cash or something. You do understand banks make money from spreads. Signaling to investors you are taking depositer cash, and investing them in 3-month t-bills yielding 0.25% is a great way to tell them you don't actually have a business model and is a money losing startup like Wework or some shit.\"}, {'text': 'I have written about TSLA before.

They are sold out for months and months depending on the model and market. Their energy division grows in the background, and nobody notices. Other EV makers talk big, but do not have the battery supply chains. They can\\'t make enough EVs to matter.\\n\\n(See Back Ground posts below. For some reason, Reddit won\\'t let me post the links. )\\n\\nWhat really matters is the PE ratio and growth. I have written about this before in the above posts. Right now, it is about 57. Which really isn\\'t that high for a company that is doing such huge growth. They made 1.3 million vehicles in 2022. But they are already as of now, at a production rate of 1.7million vehicles.

I will try to make this short and simple. I believe TSLA is headed towards a $2T Market Cap.\\n\\n**PE Ratio**\\n\\nThe PE Ratio measures current share price relative to its per-share earnings. This reflects how much an investor is willing to pay for earnings.\\n\\nFor a company not rapidly expanding, a normal P/E ratio is around 20:1. The average PE for the S&P is something like 15.\\n\\nWe have all read about TSLA having an insanely high PE ratio in the past. That was before they started making over $1B per quarter.\\n\\nNow the PE ratio is lower, but still very high.\\n\\nTSLA is currently around a PE of 112 for forward earnings. The stock costs \\\\~$650 per share. And the earnings per share were $1.45 for Q2.\\n\\nSo 650/ (1.45 x 4 quarters) = A forward PE of about 110.\\n\\n(I am multiplying by the most recent Q2 and assuming the earnings are the same going forward for the sake of simplicity in this example)\\n\\nAnother way is to take annual earnings and the total market cap of the company. Their recent earnings were about $1.14B in Q2. So assume $4.56Billion for the next year.\\n\\n$622B market cap / 4.56B annual earnings = PE ratio of \\\\~135\\n\\nThis is with them making around 200,000 vehicles per quarter in Q2 2020. Or an annualized rate of just over 800,00 vehicles per year. Just doing an average of 1.14Billion / 200,000 gives us about $5,000 \"per car\". This ignores the energy sectors and software, solar, etc. Just a point of reference for an average.\\n\\n**Future**\\n\\nDoes anyone expect Tesla to be standing still for the next few years?\\n\\nOf course not.\\n\\nWith Berlin and Texas coming online, Tesla may reach 900,000 cars this year. In 2022 they will likely be well over 1.5million cars per year. So let\\'s assume that by 2024 they are making 3 million cars per year.\\n\\n3,000,000 cars x $5,000 per car = $15Billion per year in earnings.\\n\\nHow about with $8,000 per car?\\n\\n=$24Billion\\n\\n$24Billion x 30 = $720Billion Market Cap\\n\\nHow about a PE ration of 50. Since this seems like something investors have had no trouble tolerating over the life of TSLA\\'s stock.\\n\\n$24B x 50 = $1.2T Market Cap.\\n\\nLet\\'s try that again for 2028\\n\\nAssume 6million cars per year and profits of $12,000 per car as efficiencies ramp up across all sectors.\\n\\nThis gives an annual earnings of $72B.\\n\\n((-Again, this sort of ignores the energy sector, software potential, etc.\\n\\n\\\\-Just the $10/month that Tesla charges for premium connectivity will become a high margin revenue generator. Around 2023 or 2024 Tesla will have about 5million cars on the road being charged the monthly cost.\\n\\n$120/year x 5,000,000 cars = $600,000,000 per year in mostly profit.\\n\\n\\\\-The Supercharger costs to other Automakers could also become a huge revenue generator. ))\\n\\n**A PE ratio of 30 on $72B is $2.1T**\\n\\nThis would be a stock price around $2200 per share.\\n\\nIf Investors are willing to tolerate a higher PE, then the Market Cap could hit 2T much sooner.\\n\\n**Other Notes**\\n\\nIt is worth considering that if the stock gets into the Low $1,000s, Tesla may split it again. When it was announced last time there was a massive increase in the stock price before the split. It went from the low 1,000s to the mid $2,000s. The Mid $2,000s would be a Market Carp \\\\~ $2T.\\n\\nEdit: No matter what you think about \\'FSD\\', it should be easy for everyone to accept that once Tesla gets FSD approved in a single jurisdiction, the stock will also jump through the roof. It doesn\\'t matter if it will be in 2022, 2023, or 20XX, etc. I left that out since it is a whole separate discussion. And is not needed for my math of a $2T market cap.\\n\\nDon\\'t listen to me. Ignore my assumptions. Invest in Banana futures.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nAnother Older Post\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nGreetings fellow simians and proto-simians,\\n\\nI wrote a post a while back that got some interest about being long TSLA.\\n\\nI won\\'t rehash the $2T market cap position.

All this will be done without a realization of FSD. That will have a huge change on stock price as soon as it is approved in a single jurisdiction.\\n2. Also, Please note, that once TSLA gets into the low thousands, another Stock Split is likely. Last time a stock split was announced the price went from the low $1,000s to the low $2,000s by the time of the Split.\\n\\n**Tesla Advantages**\\n\\nA) Tesla has more battery supply contracts.No other company can come close to Tesla on quantity or KWHr/$ cost for battery packs.(VW has substantial contracts. But even then, it seems unlikely their vendors will be able to actually obtain enough raw material supply.)For Example, the moron Executives at Ford did not even realize that the EV Battery Supply for the world was already contracted out for Years.\\n\\nB) Software/Over the Air........In 2021, not even VW can figure this out.\\n\\nC) Software based UI\\n\\nLess buttons, cables, supply chain.The cost is in the supply chain.People think the minimalist interior of the 3 and Y are driven by Elon\\'s ego. But really, the less stuff = less costs. Less install, less holding and supply costs, less wires, etc etc.The lack of traditional air vents might look cool, but it is really about having less parts.\\n\\nD) Supercharger Network.Tesla has the largest charging network in the World. This is a huge revenue generator and asset for Tesla Owners.\\n\\nE) Tesla Sells more EVs in North America/US than all the other OEMs put together...... x 4.[https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020](https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020)\\n\\nF) If you count road trip capable EVs, (can charge fast enough) Tesla sells over 90%.The crappy leafs and bolt type EVs cannot charge fast enough for a road trip.\\n\\nG) People hate car dealerships more than the Dentist for a lot of reasons. People like buying things online and not having to interact with other humans. Besides just being able to order online, with a Tesla, you can see the actual price of the actual car. That is the price. It is nearly impossible to get an actual out-the-door price from a legacy dealer until the final paperwork for the car.As consumers become more and more aware of this, it will be a sales advantage for Tesla.\\n\\nH) The potential EV market is huge.\\n\\nEvery Dinosaur OEM is always stunned when their EV offerings sell out in minutes. People want EVs. Tesla is not really competing against other EVs. They are taking sales of dinosaur ICE sales.\\n\\nG) Tesla Engineers in different areas work together. In a normal OEM world, the radiator team does not work with the regen-break team. Tesla staff do work together. So there is less bulk and unneeded parts in Tesla products.\\n\\nH) The \"Model 2\" is likely to be announced soon. This is the cheaper compact EV expected to be made and marketed in China.\\n\\nI) All Teslas are capable of Road Trips.(Big Enough Battery, Efficient enough Mileage, Fast Enough Charge Rate miles per minutes charging). Not to mention robust enough charging network.\\n\\nJ). Right now, it is very difficult in the lower 48 to be more than 75 miles from a Tesla Supercharger. It is also very difficult to be on an expressway and be more than 50miles from a Supercharger. This is a huge asset and Tesla is already there now. Not in a few years.[https://supercharge.info/map](https://supercharge.info/map)\\n\\nK) Seamless Supercharging.Have you ever used a non-Tesla fast charger? The process is awful. The stalls might be broken, they don\\'t handshake with the car, the payment doesn\\'t work etc. They are in shopping parking lots instead of along major travel routes.\\n\\n**Disadvantages**\\n\\nA) Non-FSD chip Supply(Shouldn\\'t affect Tesla more than any other OEM. But may have more airtime in the media due to FUD spreaders)\\n\\nB) FUD in the media. Example: Jalopnik has a huge audience. But they can\\'t print an accurate story about Tesla if their lives depended on it. Reading the Jalopnik comments on a Tesla Story is like listening to conspiracy rants from the Capitol Rioters. Tesla gets them clicks. Printing something sensational gets clicks. Here is an example. Many outlets, including Jalopnik, recently reported that Tesla finally made a profit without Reg Credits (pollution emission credits). Except that Tesla has made a profit in the past without Reg Credits. It is hard to believe someone writing an article could be this bad at math and research. Taxes are paid on income from Reg Credits. So you have to subtract both the income AND the taxes on that income if you want to know Tesla\\'s Quarterly balance sheet without Reg Credits. \\\\*\\\\* Math Below\\n\\n**Other OEMs are mostly Morons**\\n\\nA) Ford has paired with SK to make a factory that can make 125GWHrs per year.....in 2025.This is a decent amount of battery supply. But again, this is really only enough Batteries for <2 million cars annually...by 2025. And this is if they can even get the supply contracts for raw materials. Tesla Will be making 2 Million electric cars per year by the middle of 2023 if not sooner.\\n\\nB) Most other electric cars in North America are still compliance nonsense like the Bolts.\\n\\nB1) The Bolts are really just there to sell Silverados. The Bolts can\\'t fast charge enough for a road trip. The Bolts catch fire and have recalls that aren\\'t reported much in the news. Could you imagine if Tesla told people to stop charging their vehicles indoors or unattended? There would be articles calling for Blood.\\n\\nB2) The MachE is a good car spec wise. (It really is a compliance car for the EU though)But was clearly designed by a company that is Silo\\'d. Meaning the engineering groups do not work together. Sandy Munro - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU)\\n\\nB3) There are only a handful of non-Tesla electric cars in North America in models and total quantity that can actually charge fast enough for non-local driving. Most of these are pricey. It is Q3 2021. Selling an EV that can only charge at 150KW peak charge rate is a joke. Even the ID4 is more like 125KW.\\n\\nC) GM appears to be MoronsThese people paired with Nikola. How dumb could a company be?Anyone who follows the EV space knew that Nikola was vaporware long before the latest fraud accusations.\\n\\n[https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/)\\n\\nD) Tesla is sold out for Months. (2022 forfor some)This is a great problem to have in most circumstances. If you want a Tesla in 2021, you should be ordering it now.\\n\\nE) There are something like 1.2 million Cybertruck reservations.\\n\\nEven if only half of those turn into actual orders, that is still $40 Billion in revenue.\\n\\nPresumably more and more orders will come in once deliveries start being made and people see them in person.[https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html)\\n\\nFor comparison, the F150 lighting has about 150,000 reservations/orders. Which is great. Except that Ford has no battery supply to deliver most of these for the next several years.\\n\\nF. Toyota is still Gaslighting us about Hydrogen.\\n\\n[https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/)\\n\\nG. People think a common parts bin is an asset. It mostly is not. If you are designing common EVs, then yes sure, a common parts bin makes sense. But what it really has done to most offerings from Dinosaur OEMs has forced decisions that were based on the part; not the design need. See Sandy Munro videos for examples. But the MachE is a good example.\\n\\n**Ranting about Hydrogen Fuel Cells**\\n\\nZZ) Hydrogen is for snake oil for Gaslighting morons. Most people think that Hydrogen is burned in Fuel cells cars. HFCs actually work like this: You put a bunch of energy into making, storing, and transporting hydrogen, then later, you get a small small amount of that energy back. Each KG of Hydrogen created will produce about 9KG of C02. (before accounting for storage and transport)[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\* TSLA Q3 2020 Example\\n\\n[https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/)\\n\\nPeople who spread that myth are not recognizing that taxes are paid on reg credit income.Reg credits have taxes paid on them.\\n\\nLess Income = Less Taxes.Income from Reg Credits is taxed.\\n\\n555 income before taxes186 paid in taxes= about 34% tax rate\\n\\nIf people claim that they only made a profit from regulatory credits, then subtract out regulatory credits AND the taxes paid on them.555 - 397= \\\\~158\\n\\n158 \\\\* tax rate of 34% or so = 53milli in taxes\\n\\n158-53mil in taxes = over 100mil in profit.\\n\\nThe point being they have made a profit in previous quarters without reg credits. It is just that most journalists are too lazy to understand math.\\n\\nAs always, don\\'t listen to me.

I will justify this trade by demonstrating that the aforementioned tranches create an abnormally favorable risk/reward profile due to Alibaba’s unreasonably low valuation, which will be demonstrated by financial analysis, an analysis of all the major risks to the value of the underlying security, and an analysis of growth factors due to macroeconomic as well as company-specific factors. Additionally, low implied volatility further improves the risk/reward profile. In recent years, options have become tightly associated with gambling. This paper, however, will show that purchasing these LEAPS are not a gamble, but rather an investment; that is, unlike in gambling, where the expected value is almost always negative, I believe the likelihood of gain far exceeds the likelihood of loss, in spite of potential returns exceeding 1,000%, and losses being capped at 100%. This paper can be used to formulate a concentrated bet on Alibaba that mitigates risk by risking less capital than a much larger purchase in the underlying security (which would be necessary to have the same potential gains).\\n\\n# Thesis Distilled Into Actionable Information:\\n\\nA fair value estimate of Alibaba’s current share price, using conservative inputs, visualized below, yields a price of **$294.33 per share**.\\n\\nIn order to ameliorate the risk of this model being overly rosy, or unforeseen problems, I will discount 25% from my simplified intrinsic value calculation when choosing the strike price for LEAPS. On the flipside, contracts will only be sold when the share price reaches 25% above the fair value estimate, or otherwise held until expiration.\\n\\nStrike Price: \\\\~$220.75\\n\\nExit Price: \\\\~$367.91\\n\\nContract Price: $953.00\\n\\nContract Value at Exit Price: $15,000\\n\\nP/L: 1,474%\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**19th Dec 2025 $220**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/capjwyuykgga1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=f940bd8aba641d449ec04e52e9fd139a6d84b7fa\\n\\n## \\n\\n# Revenue\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/utrb7w9zkgga1.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff72165e10a23b085f749a9ea353febad4765fa9\\n\\n# \\n\\nAlibaba’s revenue, visualized above, has grown dramatically over the past decade. In fact, since 2014, the year of its IPO, Alibaba’s revenue has grown from $7.7B USD annually to an impressive $125.8B USD.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0bxp1kt0lgga1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e791d23238618e46be811bf607c2690b30bd2ef\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIn spite of its revenue increasing 16x in this period, its stock price, which more than doubled initially, has meandered back down to a price only 2.7% above its November 2014 high. An undiscerning investor might argue that this increase in revenue, as well as the downstream improvements on earnings and other financial metrics it caused, was priced into the stock (i.e. investors expected this increase, and therefore it is sensible for the stock price to remain relatively unchanged). My refutation to this is simple–no reasonable investor could possibly expect any company to grow this much, this quickly. Instead, the enormous discrepancy in price between 2014 and 2022 says one of two things–that Alibaba was dramatically overvalued in 2014, or Alibaba is dramatically undervalued today. The first case, quite simply, is absurd. If valuations in 2014 were overvalued to the extent that a 16x increase in revenue was priced into the stock, then the 2020 highs of over $300/share would represent extreme mania. The rest of this paper is to prove that the latter case is the correct one.\\n\\n# Earnings\\n\\nIn the analysis of Alibaba’s earnings, I should first begin by examining the earnings of the past five years and create a price to earnings ratio that corresponds to the average net income in this time period. This smooths out the effect of one-off expenses or windfalls, as well as any variables that may affect earnings temporarily without affecting the overall outlook of the company.\\n\\nHistorical Data\\n\\n5 Year Average Net Income: 15.4B\\n\\n5 Year Average EPS (Current Share Price): $5.82\\n\\nP/E (Avg 5y Earnings) = 20.34\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uyqfi5g3ngga1.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6085f9f7c90b0df93cfc2d5686a1bb43cc4769b\\n\\n## Future Analysis\\n\\nOn average, analysts forecast that Alibaba’s EPS will be $6.32 for 2023, with the lowest EPS forecast at $5.83, and the highest EPS forecast at $6.81. On average, analysts forecast that BABA\\'s EPS will be $7.03 for 2024, with the lowest EPS forecast at $6.60, and the highest EPS forecast at $7.47. In 2025, BABA\\'s EPS is forecast to hit $8.56 (min: $8.13, max: $8.99).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4qrhog4lgga1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=23f264238d1441f85901dc18ea66c26c7e480ecc\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBalance Sheet\\n\\nAlibaba total assets for the quarter ending September 30, 2022 totaled $240.746B.\\n\\nAlibaba total liabilities for the quarter ending September 30, 2022 totaled $89.941B.\\n\\nAlibaba book value = $51.01 / share\\n\\nAlibaba has accumulated $74.2B in cash–this could be deployed in numerous ways that are beneficial to shareholders.\\n\\nAlibaba Stock Buybacks:\\n\\n* Were Alibaba to use its entire $74.2B cash hoard in order to buyback stock, it could buy back 23.7% of the stock, reducing its P/E (Past 5 years) to 15.52, it’s P/E (Future 3y) to 12.34, and it’s P/E (2025) to 10.55\\n\\nAlibaba–with all its associated infrastructure, intellectual property, assets, employees, goodwill, established brands, and existing businesses, has an earning potential that is valued at its current stock price less the book value (liquidation value). In other words, Alibaba’s ability to generate profits indefinitely into the future is being valued by the market at $67.37/share x 2.65B shares =\\n\\n$178.34B\\n\\n# Benjamin Graham Formula\\n\\nThe Benjamin Graham Formula is a formula used for the valuation of growth stocks. Based on the study of various methods, Graham suggested the formula as a foreshortened and simple way to produce figures fairly close to those resulting from more refined mathematical calculations. The formula is as follows:\\n\\nV\\\\*=EPS (8.5+2g)\\n\\nWhere\\n\\nV\\\\*= the value expected from the growth formulas\\n\\nEPS = trailing twelve months earning per share\\n\\n8.5 = P/E base for a no growth company\\n\\ng = reasonably expected 7 to 10 year growth rate\\n\\nImplementing the appropriate values from Alibaba’s financials, we get\\n\\nV\\\\*=$6.32 (8.5+2(15))\\n\\nV\\\\*=$243.32 / Share\\n\\nAlibaba Book Value = $51.01 / Share\\n\\nPresent Value = V\\\\* + Book Value = $294.33 / Share\\n\\n# Risks\\n\\n## Delisting\\n\\nOne of the biggest fears surrounding Alibaba is the possibility of it being delisted from the NYSE. There are two parties that could hypothetically cause this to happen. The first party is Chinese regulators. China has forced companies to delist in the past (DIDI) due to the fear of data breaches. This shouldn’t be a major concern for shareholders of Alibaba, as delisting seems unlikely given the China-U.S. audit agreement which has already been carried out without rumor of auditing issues. Additionally, even if China did force Alibaba to delist, shares would be available OTC and on the Hong Kong exchange. As a result, options contracts can still be executed, and shares purchased at the strike price can be sold OTC or converted to Hong Kong shares at their full value.\\n\\nRecently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) announced that it had concluded its audit review of U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. By all accounts, the review went well. The SEC completed its work ahead of schedule, indicating that the inspections went smoothly. Today, the PCAOB further announced that it had received good access to Chinese companies’ books after “thorough and systematic testing.” It’s impossible to say for sure that the total review went well (there’s more to audits than just \"accessing\" things), but the swift conclusion and glowing comments suggest that the SEC is about to hand investors some good news.\\n\\n## Regulation\\n\\nWhat started with Alibaba founder Jack Ma publicly criticizing Chinese regulators, turned into a year-long “tech crackdown,” or at least what the business media has portrayed as such. Between Ant’s planned IPO getting stymied and it being forced to restructure in line with the CCP agenda , to the 2.8 billion-dollar USD anti-monopoly fine Alibaba was given, Alibaba’s market cap has fallen over 60% from a high of over $800 billion USD in October 2020 to recent lows of just over $300 billion.\\n\\nThe goal of the crackdown is to promote common prosperity, ensure data security, and stopping monopolistic practices. Although hurting Alibaba’s bottom line (and share price) temporarily, a lot of what the CCP is doing may actually benefit the Chinese people, and ultimately may end up helping Alibaba grow long term. Moreover, Alibaba has been taking steps to try and please the CCP, including pledging $15.5 billion USD to the common prosperity goals, changing monopolistic behavior, and attempting to sell their Weibo stake to a state-owned company.\\n\\nThe risks from the CCP are real, and while there have been whispers that the crackdown is easing in 2023, no one can know for certain what the CCP will implement day to day. These risks are included in my valuation of Alibaba by adjusting cash flows as necessary.\\n\\n## Competition\\n\\nThe scale advantage of being the largest player in the ecommerce market has become more and more apparent in countries like the U.S. with Amazon, making ecommerce appear to be a winner takes all game. This fact can be attributed to the following reasons, among others: the platform that sells the most will almost always have the lowest price; the platform that sells the most will almost always have the lowest logistics cost; the more sales you have, the more you can invest in software; the more scale you have, the more variety of products you will have. The somewhat lopsided ecommerce market share distribution in China reflects the idea that the advantages that come along with scale results in fewer, more dominant companies- in 2021, Alibaba had a 47.1% share of the ecommerce market in China, compared to JD.com with a 16.9% share and Pinduodu have a 13.2 % share. The following table shows the top 6 companies in China, ranked by retail e-commerce sales, 2019-2022:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4w5o71p6lgga1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f8cb43b622f6795379ade194bc48f7670fc2a53\\n\\nOfcourse, ecommerce appearing to be a winner takes all market and Alibaba’s as of yet dominant market share does not necessarily entail that Alibaba will be the monolithic giant that emerges from the Chinese ecommerce market. Rather, it reveals two important facts that are almost equally compelling to an investor: Alibaba has room to grow, and it holds significant advantages in doing so.\\n\\nWhere the analogy between U.S. and Chinese ecommerce markets fails is that in China, there seems to be a more democratized access to logistics platforms. Whereas in the US, Amazon does not open up these capabilities to competition, Cainiao, the Alibaba-owned smart logistics network that does more than 50% of all package deliveries in China, has opened up their logistics platform to other eCommerce players. Consequently, the investments they make into providing fast, same day or next day delivery to most Chinese cities can be leveraged by many other players. However, although Alibaba will open up their Cainiao network to other competitors, they price it, and financial analysts believe they will do so differently, thus implying that Alibaba can retain its dominance on its own terms. So, in any case, the ‘whale’ may very well pull away here too, eventually.\\n\\nIt’s worth going into more detail how Alibaba fairs against JD.com, its largest competitor in China. JD.com is a direct-sales retailer that uses a model similar to Amazon. In contrast to Alibaba\\'s ecommerce model, JD.com warehouses, markets, and ships merchandise directly to Chinese consumers through its national shipping network, which includes a last-mile delivery component throughout much of the nation. With direct control over its supply chain, JD.com has developed a reputation for authentic products and reliable, fast shipping. Alibaba, on the other hand, has long battled an association with counterfeit goods among both domestic and international customers and brand owners. To address these concerns, Alibaba established a dual operation strategy by creating two platforms, Taobao and Tmall, Taobao being a platform for small vendors, and Tmall being a platform exclusively for major brands.\\n\\nNot only has Alibaba closed in on JD.com’s reputational advantage, but in its growth has has created various other significant edges of its own. The first is that Alibaba has significantly higher margins than JD.com. The second, Alibaba is a much more diversified company. While JD.com’s sole focus has been ecommerce, Alibaba receives significant revenue streams from Alipay, its online payment platform, and Aliyun, its cloud computing platform. The third, Alibaba has been much more successful in international markets. Alibaba’s preeminence in the cloud and international markets allows it to compensate for potentially slower growth in Chinese commerce.\\n\\nTo go into more detail about how the two companies square up, it\\'s useful to look more closely at the financial indicators of both companies. Below is a table of common financial indicators of Alibaba and JD.com:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/edxpgyo7lgga1.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc0bb169f7191b2777f23847ec9aefb9dd6bb90a\\n\\nInterestingly, despite the fact the market share of Alibaba in the ecommerce market is higher than that of JD.com, right now Alibaba’s total revenue is somewhat lower than that of JD.com. At the same time, Alibaba has been showing a far better revenue growth performance than JD for many years.'}, {'text': '**Elevator pitch**\\n\\n* REC   Silicon is a leader in silane-based, high-purity silicon materials.

Wafers are made into solar cells, and then  solar  panels. By using Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR) technology, using  one-tenth  of the electricity needed for Siemens technology, affords  low-cost  material and ultra-low carbon footprint, making its solar  module value  chain more sustainable. FBR is the patented technology of  the company,  and makes it possible produce solar-grade polysilicon in a  continuous,  rather than a batch, process. This makes REC Silicon one  of the most  efficient producers of solar-grade silicon in the world,  and their  product is some of the least expensive silicon available for  solar  panels.\\n\\nUsing  hydropower-based  clean energy, REC Silicon produces low-carbon  polysilicon without  emitting greenhouse gases. Compared to carbon-heavy  polysilicon  manufactured overseas that often relies on coal power, REC  Silicon\\'s  “clean polysilicon” is expected to draw more demand in the  coming years  as international scrutiny over industrial emissions and  carbon  footprints grows.\\n\\nA quick  recap.  REC Silicon\\'s biggest plant shut down in 2019. Without access to  Chinese  market, their lifeline got cut off. There was no solar module  value  chain outside of China. Now, almost four years later, things are  looking  brighter. Solar module value chains are forming in both the  U.S. and  Europe. REC Silicon is teaming up with Hanwha Q CELLS, for  delivery of  solar grade polysilicon. As of this writing, they have  ongoing  negotiations with Hanwha Solutions towards reaching an offtake  agreement  for all FBR polysilicon production ([https://recsilicon.com/news-article/?slug=rec-silicon-update-of-restart-and-offtake-activities-in-moses-lake](https://recsilicon.com/news-article/?slug=rec-silicon-update-of-restart-and-offtake-activities-in-moses-lake)).   With Hanwha Q CELLS being one of the most trusted names, and ambitious   companies in the solar industry, this is of course promising.\\n\\nEver   since Hanwha became the largest shareholder, they have been promoting   REC Silicon as a vital part of their bigger plan. The importance of  this  newborn partnership is certainly no secret to Hanwha, and this is   highlighted by the statements below.\\n\\n>*This   year, Hanwha also acquired REC Silicon, a crucial step along the   company’s path to building out a full solar value chain, and expanded   its plans for its green energy businesses in the U.S. thanks to the   incentives in the groundbreaking Inflation Reduction Act.*([https://www.hanwha.com/en/news\\\\_and\\\\_media/stories/sustainability/hanwhas-year-in-review-2022.html).-----](https://www.hanwha.com/en/news_and_media/stories/sustainability/hanwhas-year-in-review-2022.html).-----)*By   investing in REC Silicon, with US plants that produce special gas for   semiconductor as well as polysilicon, we are expanding our business  into  high value–added core industrial materials.* ([https://www.hanwha.com/en/products\\\\_and\\\\_services/chemicals-materials.html).-----](https://www.hanwha.com/en/products_and_services/chemicals-materials.html).-----)*By   becoming the largest shareholder of REC Silicon, Hanwha will expand  its  renewable energy portfolio in the U.S. and help American businesses   secure raw material critical to the solar supply chain.

Welcome to some DD. Below I intend to discuss the company Denison Mining ticker DNN, what they do, why I like them, some of their risks, and why I\\'m long term bullish. As a warning this is a long play on a company I like, there is no squeeze play here. There is no 0DTE, weekly or even monthly play to be had. This is about a company that won\\'t even be earning money until 2025 (Though the price should rise well before then). If you\\'re looking for your next get rich quick YOLO, this isn\\'t it. but if you want to learn about a good company that can make you some money feel free to read.  Now as always, I realize I’m writing this for 3 people since it\\'s not some YOLO quick cash grab, so I’ll get right to this.\\n\\n**Denison What they do?**\\n\\nBefore we dive into a company, logically one would want to know what does this company even do. Well let me answer that for you simply, they dig up rocks. More specifically, they dig up green glowing rocks. Or at least that’s what they want to do. See Denison is something in the mining world called a development company. What this means is they have a nice patch of land with the rock they want to dig up, in this case uranium. What they don’t have is an actual mine up and running to do this. They’re in the process of developing a mine (Hence development company). Now to be more specific, Denison has 2 patches of uranium in Canada they are hoping to turn into mining projects: Phoenix, their flagship project and Gryphon. Their plan as a company is to build mines at each site, pull uranium out of the ground and sell it for money. Pretty simple business model.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Uranium? Waste of Time!**\\n\\nI already did a very long sector DD on uranium and why it isn\\'t as dead as many people feel.  Feel free to check the link below if you want to read the full thing. For the sake of this I\\'ll keep it simple. Nuclear energy is not being replaced in the next 5 years. It accounts for 18% of all US electrical generation and that\\'s going to take a very long time to turn into wind or solar. I\\'m not saying nuclear power plants are the future or anything. I\\'m saying the US isn\\'t going to just replace 18% of their electrical generation over night, and they can\\'t allow it to just disappear, unless blackouts sound cool. But again, check the DD below if you want more info. I have enough to discuss here so I\\'m moving on.\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z358vi/dd\\\\_uranium\\\\_sector\\\\_come\\\\_glow\\\\_with\\\\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z358vi/dd_uranium_sector_come_glow_with_me/)\\n\\n**Athabasca Basin**\\n\\nI’m going to go into specifics about the area Denison’s projects are located, feel free to skip if this doesn’t interest you. Denison’s two projects are located in a specific area of Canada called the Athabasca Basin. [Here’s a link if you want to learn about this sector of Canada for some reason](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/educational-resources/history-geological-survey-canada-175-objects/43-athabasca-basin-1888). And here\\'s a photo for the visual folks.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4995dxaj9oca1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=073b91bda1164d693b48225d60511b678261ee5d\\n\\nNow here’s the think to know about this area, it is the place to find and mine uranium. You get the highest grades of anywhere on the planet here. Forget Africa digging up slightly enriched sand, Athabasca Basin pulls some crazy numbers. Kazakhstan has the cheapest uranium, but that\\'s because they have very low environmental regulations keeping price down. Athabasca has by far the highest quality. [Here’s an article talking about just how good Athabasca Basin is compared to other areas for those who want more reading](https://investorintel.com/energy-oil-gas-uranium/canadas-athabasca-basin-the-worlds-richest-uranium-play/). Now I don’t want to spend hours boring you with geological surveys and other information. It will take too long to write up and let’s be real, 99% of you will skip it anyway because it’ll have no meaning to you. What I want to emphasize here is this, Denison is working on 2 projects in what is considered the premiere location for uranium mining. It has the highest grades, the best deposits and is a very mining friendly jurisdiction (Both the local government and first nation’s people tend to permit mining projects so long as they follow guidelines). So big takeaway, projects in a mining friendly area that often has high quality projects. And that’s exactly what Denison has found, quality projects in a quality area.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Ok Let’s Talk Project.**\\n\\nAs stated before, Denison has two main projects, Phoenix and Griffin. These projects are located on a patch called Wheeler River. Here\\'s another photo for the visual folks.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5oukm923aoca1.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc0f667ddc652defad459d5f528d46f7c87bd9d3\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n And as stated Phoenix is the flagship project for them. So, let’s break these two projects down.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n*Gryphon:* This is Denison’s “lesser” project, though that’s not to say it’s worth dismissing. But if you want you can 100% skip this and go right to Phoenix since that’s the project that will likely drive the company’s price. Gryphon is located on Wheeler River, the site of Denison\\'s two projects. Denison conducted a Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) in 2018 for the entire Wheeler River location, which included both Gryphon and Phoenix. This study is designed to assess several things, but the most important ones are the economic merit (Is it worth the money being put in to make a mine) and the environmental impact. [You can find an overview of the entire projects and their results here,](https://denisonmines.com/projects/core-projects/wheeler-river-project/) but I’ll sum it up for you. Gryphon is estimated to have 49.7M lbs of U3O8 (1,257,000 tonnes at 1.8% U3O8). [This 1.8% grade falls in line with similar projects in the Basin and well above sandstone projects that run between 0.05-0.4%. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_ore#Unconformity-related_deposits)Now there are better grades out there, Cameco’s McArthur River has an average grade around 18%, but that’s a very special project. Don’t let that high number distract you into thinking Gryphon is graded low, it is a very good grade with medium graded projects falling at only 0.50%. The project is estimated to cost Denison $11.70 per pound in operation costs with an estimated initial capital investment of $465.1 million, an estimated 77% profit margin at $50/lb uranium and an all-in cost of $22.82. (The all-in cost is the most important pricing since it tells you how much per pound it costs when EVERYONE is paid, and equipment expenses covered. Always look at the all-in cost compared to the SPOT price when evaluating a mining project). In Denison\\'s words \"The Gryphon deposit is designed as an underground mining operation, utilizing a conventional long hole mining approach with processing of mine production assumed at Denison’s 22.5% owned McClean Lake mill.\" The mill is important as it will be used to process the ore coming out of Gryphon, and since Denison has a stake in it, they won’t be looking for expensive milling agreements which can cost companies a large percentage of their ore to sign. Now as I said, this is not their premiere project, and Denison doesn’t expect to have this running until 2030. But it is worth mentioning as a quality project the company owns.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n*Phoenix:* Alright let’s get to the big boy, Phoenix. The project that justifies owning this company. Phoenix is estimated to have a 10-year mine life, producing an average of 6 million pounds/year. The grade is super high at 59.7 million lbs U3O8 (141,000 tonnes at 19.1% U3O8) and yes that’s an amazing 19% grade, which matches the top-level projects of even Cameco. An average operating cost of $3.33 per pound, $241 million initial capital cost, 89% profitable at $29 per pound uranium and has an all-in cost of $8.90, which is insanely cheap. I want to be clear, if pulled off, Phoenix would become one of the highest grade and lowest cost projects on the entire planet. They’re 89% profitable at $29 uranium and [RIGHT NOW uranium is trading at $49 per pound](https://twitter.com/numerco) and is projected to go UP in price. In fact, the global all-in sustaining costs to meet yearly demand is around $65-70, that’s double the price Phoenix needs to hit 89% profitability. Phoenix is projected to be online by early 2025.\\n\\n**More About Phoenix**\\n\\nSo as established above, Phoenix has the potential to be a top project globally. So, the question becomes, why isn’t everyone buying this company if the project is so good? Well, here’s the thing, the reason Phoenix is projected to be so profitable is twofold, the first is the high grade, but the second is the mining method. See Phoenix has a problem, it’s deep in the ground and while it\\'s high quality the patch isn\\'t large enough to justify a conventional mine like Gryphon. And that’s the type of mine used in the Basin, a conventional mine. But it’s not the only mine. I’m not going to get into every mine type, but I will bring up the one that matters In Situ Recovery (ISR). [Now if you want a big in depth read, look here.](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/in-situ-leach-mining-of-uranium.aspx#:~:text=In%20situ%20leaching%20(ISL)%2C,the%20minerals%20can%20be%20recovered.) But if you’d rather I tell you, listen up. In Situ Recovery is a mining method used by about 50% of all uranium mines on the planet. It’s rather simple. You make a well in the ground where uranium is, you fill it with an acidic solution (think soda water), you let the solution dissolve the uranium, you suck up the solution with the dissolved uranium, you do a lot of processes to evaporate the solution leaving behind powdered uranium, you put the powder in barrels, and you sell it. That’s the super basics of it, feel free to read the link above to find out more. Now here’s the thing about ISR in the Basin, they can’t do it. The soil doesn’t allow ISR mining, it’s too porous and the solution will leach out. So, nobody does it. They’ve tried, they’ve failed, they’ve given up. There is no ISR mining in the Basin at all.\\n\\n**Denison’s Freeze Wall**\\n\\nNow you might be thinking “But Rad you said Denison needs ISR but can’t do it, what’s up?” Well, here’s the thing. Denison is working on a brand-new mining method they’re calling a freeze wall. What is a freeze wall? Well, It’s simple (not really but whatever). Denison plans to build a wall of ice around their wells in order to prevent the solution from escaping. See the image below as an example.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vplrt00wboca1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=83b900d4cdfc3123bdd5655e59a83fad8aa0741a\\n\\nHere’s their exact explanation of this project “At Wheeler, in order to contain the solution within the uranium deposit and maximize recovery as well as prevent interaction of the mining solution with surrounding groundwater, Denison will create an isolated mining chamber using conventional ground freezing technology. Ground freezing will establish an impermeable barrier above and on all sides of the mining chamber, with the existing impermeable basement rock acting as a bottom barrier. The approximate dimensions of the mining chamber are 100 m wide x 30 m high x 1,300 m long, and it will be located approximately 400 m below the surface.”\\n\\nThis is the key to their entire company. Either they pull off this freeze wall and become a top global project making massive returns or it fails, and this project is done. A very binary bet. But one I think is worth making. See Denison has done several field tests on their ISR project, and to date, they have been able to t successfully contain any leaking, recover the solution AND recover uranium in their testing. [You can read here about their most recent successful field test published on December 12th of 2022. ](https://denisonmines.com/news/denison-announces-successful-completion-of-neutral-122782/)The long story short, it was a full-on success and while the process isn’t fully proven, it’s a major step to derisking and proving out this new mining method.\\n\\n**ISR in the Basin Offers More**\\n\\nSo, I’ve mentioned how this process would open up a major mine for Denison and how ALL field tests have been positive so far. But there’s another major upside here. If they prove this tech out, it opens major avenues for Denison. Frist, Denison now can turn to any nearby project that was deemed unfeasible due to being too deep for a conventional mine and buy it up. They now have a method to mine previously thought dead projects, projects with millions of exploration already done and PFS’s already put out. So, they’ll have the data AND be the only ones who can actually mine that patch. It opens massive growth for them. But there’s even more. Not only does it open Denison to purchasing projects, but it also makes them a massive target for a buyout. Cameco (the biggest uranium miner in Canadas) will be desperate for Denison’s ISR technology. I would not be shocked at all if after ISR is proven out Cameco comes in with a massive check to buy them and their ISR technology out. Because that’s going to be proprietary technology, and EVERYONE is going to want it. So, either Denison becomes a major player and I make bank on shares, or they receive a massive buyout and I again make bank on shares. Not a bad result.\\n\\n**Are there risks?**\\n\\nHave you read anything I wrote? Yes. ISR can fail. There is a lot of skeptics of this project with at least one former mine developer of Cameco flat out saying there is no chance Denison can ever pull this off.  It is a massive gamble because anything goes wrong, the project is done. Not delayed, not more expensive, if they can\\'t do ISR there is no Phoenix mine, period. Not to mention they can have the permits for ISR denied by the Canadian government for all sorts of reasons. And if that happens this company is going to see a near 70% drop almost immediately on that news. The risks are MASSIVE, but so is the upside, and isn’t that what we just love. Major risks with major upside.\\n\\n**Financials**\\n\\nI’m going to do a little financials here but it’s not a focus of this DD, mostly because this company really hinges on the Phoenix site and their ISR project. Also, because they’re not mining, they’re building a mine so any type of net cash flow, P/E or what not is not going to tell a good story. But we can look at their cash reserves. They have a cash reserve of $41 million USD. Additionally, they bought 2.5 million pounds of U3O8 at a weighted average price of $29.66 per pound and a total cost of approximately $74.15 million. With uranium currently trading at around $50/lb, Denison\\'s holdings are worth about $125m, or about 12.5% of the company\\'s current billion-dollar valuation. So, their combined assets are about $160 million. Denison has stated the pounds of uranium they hold will be used to help secure initial contracts as reassurance to utilities they have supply on hand they can deliver should delays happen while the mine is being built. Now you might say “But Rad, don’t they need $240 million to build their mine at Phoenix.” Why yes, they do. So, what does that mean? It means Denison will likely have to raise money before they get their Phoenix project online. So that means dilution at some point between now and 2025. But why would I ever bring up a company that will need to dilute shares? Well, here’s why. First, if they get to the point of raising the cash it means ISR was proven so the company should have already done a MASSIVE move up. Second, because if you find this company interesting, and you know they’ll have to raise cash, you can put money to the side and be ready to buy some shares when that dilution is announced. I’m giving you a chance to plan ahead here.\\n\\n**Ok So What Do I Do?**\\n\\nAh the most important and most difficult part. Do you YOLO every penny into Denison? Well let me make that simple, NO. Do you buy some now? NO. I don’t like the price now, it’s too high. I wouldn’t want to add anywhere above $1.07 personally and might be greedy and wait for it to hit $1.03. Currently it’s trading at $1.29, nowhere near where I’d buy in. But Rad, why tell us all this about a company and end with don’t buy yet. Well, because I want you to make money. I want you to be successful. So, I want you to WAIT for a good entry point. I could easily say \"Buy now YOLO go go go.\" But why do that when it\\'s over bought in my eyes. A better price will come. And I fully expect, come July Denison will give you that price, because uranium is amazing at selling off over the summer. That’s right, Rad is telling you in January to set money to the side to buy shares in July at a much lower cost. Talk about a kind dude. I’m giving you almost 5 months to prepare, a good entry target and a full DD. You’re welcome.\\n\\n**TLDR:** Nope, I\\'m not doing a TLDR for an entire company.

With the opening this morning nearly 1% red many of us would have suspected that we were set up for a repeat of last CPI where we failed to break out and started a massive leg down. However, the bulls came back full force today with an impressive recovery to not only close green but to close higher than yesterday and to close back over the daily 200ema. So the question remains where are we? Where are we headed next? \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a1o6kj4e0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7808a5470b4b69f28e85e7fb390676eebf6726b\\n\\n**Daily time frame bull vs bear case** \\n\\nBull case- today despite a massive retrace we established the daily 8ema as support once again. The daily 20ema has now crossed back over the daily 50ema, the daily ema crossed back over the daily 100ema also. IF this trend was to continue we could very well Tuesday end up with the daily 8, 20 and 50ema over the daily 100ema for the first time since January 2022. That’s correct… exactly one year ago (to the month) was the last time the daily 8, 20 and 50ema were crossed over the daily 100ema (currently at 390.5). The crossover is extremely bullish especially on that many time frames. \\n\\nThe bulls broke spy back into the 390.1 to 405.3 channel and with out losing support of that 390.1 today when it was very possible we are finding ourselves looking for a push back to that 405.3 channel resistance. I mentioned last week that my pivot was 390.1 and if we hold over that we should look for upside. This is also the first closure over the daily 200ema since Decembers CPI. \\n\\nBear case- despite the bullish appearance when we look at the last 4 days of trading have been very slow going. Most of these days have had an impressive sell off that and big morning volatility followed by a low volatility, low volume bull push. The momentum is definitely slowing. \\n\\nThis is now the 7th time we have attempted to recover over the daily 200ema since August. Only two of those 6 previous times were we able to break through the daily 200ema without having a meaningful pullback. The first time we broke through it was in August with the help of CPI and the other time we broke straight through it was November 30th. If you remember that was the day JPOW did a interview and the markets roguely rallied 3% intraday. The days that immediately followed that resulted in a retrace. Actually looking back since January where we did lose the 200ema for the first time there are very few times we have broken straight through the 200ema unless we had a major catalyst (usually a fed day) when we tested the 200ema). \\n\\nThere is also as I have mentioned since last week a cup and handle formed on the daily time frame that cup is represented by this blue rising wedge. If we lose that support (396 on Tuesday) we will see a retrace. Most cup and handles result in a 33% retrace which puts us down near 390-391 before we could see a bounce. That level is as you remember my pivot level. \\n\\nFrom a daily stand point bull to bear case… I favor bulls barely. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tc35dne0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=326a7b20fbe975b67c2e1104693d851b587808e8\\n\\nLets take a look at the bull vs. bear case on the weekly. \\n\\nNow im trying to show this the best I can here with arrows but its tough cause it clutters the chart. No one will argue that 2022 was a bear market… however, while by a technical definition we are still in a bear market… the question remains will we trade line a bear market or will we trade like a bull/ neutral market. IF we are transitioning to a neutral/ bull market then we should see a push to a high followed by a retrace and then we should push to a new high (this is represented by the blue arrows). However, IF we are still in a bear market trend and the technical will follow as such then we look to the black arrows and will look for this week to be the short peak before the next leg down. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2g0staf0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7700b6f48e5ec9b1e1860df033f0c5e6d62ec7ad\\n\\nThe current bear market cycle (waves) is represented here in this chart… as you can see in general we start a leg down -> that is followed by about a 55.6% recovery -> followed by a 1.74x drop of the short peaks recovery -> followed by a 1.09x recover of the final drop. The average total drop from peak to trough is 18.6%. \\n\\nIF we are following the black arrows and IF we are still in a bear market trend and IF technical will follow we COULD see a total drop of 18.6% from the 410 peak the week of November 28th. That means we could see a low of 334 before this cycle is over… Total peak to trough bottom is about 61 days on average which would put us from the November 28th peak at about middle to end of February. \\n\\nIf you believe we are still in a bear market and you believe in the cycles… now is your time to open march DTE puts… \\n\\nBull case- from a weekly stand point here you can see that this is the first time we have closed a full candle body over the weekly 8/20ema since the week of December 5th. There also is a clear 8/20ema crossover. With the red channel I mentioned last week of 375.6 to 408.8 with 390.1 being our pivot… since we retook our 390.1 pivot point we SHOULD see a push to 408.8 before we see any meaningful retrace. The bulls also closed us over the weekly 50ema (by about 30 cents). Near 2022/23 bear market resistance is at 403.5 (1.2%) and officially ending the whole bear market is sitting at 417.74 (4.8%). Both are very within reach. \\n\\nIf the bulls can break through 403.5 which is the new bear market resistance line I would effectively say the trend of higher lows and the bear cycle is over. \\n\\nResistance levels- 398.5 -> 403.5 -> 408.8 -> 417.7 -> 427.5\\n\\nBear case- Despite what many are calling a bullish week we are actually seeing that bulls struggled almost all week long. The cycle analysis here says that from the now of 374.77 we should see a bout a 6.5% recovery which puts us at 399.13 before we would see the next leg down. The high of the week was exactly 399.1. If the bear market trend and cycles continue this was the short peak before the next leg down and bears are going to look for the next leg down of about 11.31% (353.9) within the next 17 days. \\n\\nWith the banks this morning all giving pretty awful guidance and opening deep red (despite this intraday rally) we could look for big tech earnings which most of big tech will start presenting earnings the week of 1/23 to 1/27 and then more followed the week after. In addition on 2/1 we will have a FOMC meeting. Currently there is a 64% chance of a 25bps hike and a 36% chance of no bps hike at all… In my opinion the markets expecting a 36% chance of a 0bps is beyond insane and if and when jpow drops a 25bps or possibly a 50bps (he has said numerous times hes not ready to slow hikes).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c46wygvf0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0eb26c04b49546227a9eedb47f7afbc16a18145c\\n\\nHere is a flash back to a few things JPOW said at the last FOMC… now could this negative MoM CPI reading provoke him to slow hikes and do a 25bps? Its possible… however, with CORE MoM going up there is definitely a chance JPOW sticks with a 50bps… a 50bps would send the markets tumbling (much like June with the surprise 100bps leak). In addition IF JPOW says we will NOT pause after this February FOMC that also could send markets dumping… the final piece of the puzzle would be CPI in February… apparently the metrics for how they calculate CPI will be updated for this next release. If CPI rebounds that also would send markets in quite the spiral. \\n\\nIn short bears wanna see: bad earnings -> FOMC bps -> CPI rebound\\n\\nSupports for bulls to watch- 390.1 -> 383.1 -> 375.6\\n\\nAm I bullish or bearish? Honestly im Switzerland right now… I have been trying to be a bull the last 3 weeks and have been let down every single time. The biggest issue with the current trend is that the way the technical are presenting themselves is that we are getting clear cut setups and by the time the set up displays itself the move is done and we reverse. There is a severe lack of continuation. \\n\\nI am going to be taking a break from swings for a while until we get more of a sense of direction. The risk to reward has severely dropped. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9p14qbbg0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a3ecaea37d17d30f11db09a0ffd3564ac8123f4\\n\\nTaking a look at the futures daily here the rising wedge is just beautiful. As someone who likes TA a lot… this is about as textbook of a rising wedge as there can be… realistically until we break the support of that rising wedge you should not be shorting this and I also with how tight the peak is do no think we should take a long here either. \\n\\nFutures the bulls for the 2nd day in a row closed over the daily 200ema. The last time that happened resulted in a -2.57% sell off.. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vyd2petg0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb2c7d30698d16abf8354a09a2fb8f75276857a5\\n\\nOn the futures weekly chart we are actually trading within a pretty massive diamond pattern… for those who don’t remember a diamond pattern is essentially a massive breakout or breakdown pattern. \\n\\nMuch like our 375.6 to 408.8 channel futes has its own 3770 to 4090 channel. With the pivot being 3920 and bulls this week closing us over it this SHOULD present an opportunity to test 4030 next week. IF bulls can break through 4090 then we very well could see a push to what im calling the channel extreme of 4280. However, IF the bulls were to lose 3920 this week then I would feel more confident that this is a fake peak and that we are going to see a drop back to 3770. \\n\\nSomething to keep in mind is that the JPM collar call is at 4030 too… and puts are at 3600. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oxq7hr9h0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc3db5b5daf5ae62e54f4fee3c5f5618b7c0481c\\n\\nTaking a look at Tesla let me tell you I was highly disappointed and got absolutely crushed playing calls on Tesla over night. The pattern looked beyond ripe for a huge breakout today and what happened? Well we got news that trumped the technical and caused it to go spiraling into the ground. Impressively Tesla managed to recover almost all of the loss before close. \\n\\nEffectively Tesla broke the black bull channel and broke through the rising wedge at the same time. \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/om0vdlqh0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea19583c8fa2d2c5d482e53ce6a18387abe36f9\\n\\nNew Tesla daily looks something like this… we now have a new daily red rising wedge and a 3 day long black resistance line. We also have the blue bear channel stick intact. Despite the fact that we opened nearly 5% red we actually managed to rally and close back over the daily 8ema. This is now only the 2nd time that here has been 5 closes over the daily 8ema since September. IF we were to close a 6th candle over the daily 8ema this would be the first time since September for that to happen. \\n\\nSupport- 118.2 (red rising wedge) -> 116.4 -> 113.2\\n\\nResistance- 120.9 (black resistance) -> 122.3 -> 126.4 -> 129.5 (red rising wedge and blue bear channel)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5waq2l5i0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a73a15a78437eeebb620bef21529957887343fea\\n\\nOn a weekly time frame we are actually forming a convincing V bottom here. This is now the 2nd week in a row to close higher. However as you can see we ended up closing right at that 122.4 resistance. \\n\\nSo if we look at the last 3 weeks of trading 112.9 is clear support and 122.5 is clear resistance. We have essentially a 3 week and $10 long consolidation period here. The question is will the v bottom hold and we break out or is this a double top off 122.5 and we are headed lower…\\n\\nWe have two falling wedges here. We have the first black short term (Started in December) falling wedge that has a resistance of 112.8 for next week. That means unless tesla was to open -$10 Tuesday this falling wedge is broken. We also have the next falling red wedge at 124.2 for next week. If tesla can break through that level this wedge which dates back to September when this sell off began would effectively be broken. \\n\\nIf we see Tesla break through both of these falling wedges I would feel fairly confident in a temporary bottom being put in and that we are going to see a bounce of some decent weight over the next few weeks. There is a case to see a rally into earnings which takes place on 1/23/23. If earnings were to come in friendly we could see a continuation rally, however, a miss on earnings is most likely going to result in the next leg down. \\n\\nKey weekly support- 118.7 -> 112.8 -> 102.1 -> 94.5\\n\\nKey weekly resistance- 122.5 -> 150\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bjr5eq9j0xba1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=310c18349818e40bf28439c9960db216fce3d26d\\n\\nTaking a look at the VIX… This is officially the lowest level the VIX has touched and closed below since 1/13/22… exactly one year ago today. \\n\\nThe VIX has absolutely without a care in the world unwound. I still believe the VIX Is not a great metric anymore for making plays and I do not think that the pervious trend and previous ways we have used the VIX to trade SPY is valid anymore…\\n\\nWith that being said IF the bulls can continue the momentum on SPY we very well could see the VIX tract back in the 15s for the first time since 2021. My red zone on the VIX is 16.6 to 19.7. This is previous where the VIX has bottomed out all of 2022 before the next leg down for SPY has started. Highlighted by the blue arrows you can see every time previously it touched 19.6 or below we reversed and started the next leg down on SPY. \\n\\nSo the question which I posed back up in the beginning is this… are we trading within a neutral/ bull market again and effectively will find ourselves using different technical than we did for all of 2022 OR are we still in the bear market and the previous trends/ technical from 2022 will remain valid…\\n\\nIF you believe we are leaving bear market territory then we should continue to see the VIX unwind. Why? Well the VIX essentially measure fear… how does it measure that? Well it measures it by how many people are hedging with puts (aka downside protection). The more people with puts the higher the VIX goes. As you can see since October the VIX has steadily unwound and since the December CPI to present CPI we were trending down slightly but holding steady. Since the current CPI just printed we have unwound completely and even leading into it. \\n\\nSo IF we believe bear market is over we SHOULD expect the VIX to return to its normal mean. Which prior to 2022 bear market would be 15 to 19.7 with a outliers above and below. Most of 2021 (after March) was spent within these two levels. We should effectively find the VIX holding at these levels and find SPY to trend slowly upwards. Remember we are not in a 2020 bull market/ QE market. \\n\\nHowever, IF you are on the side that we are STILL in the bear market and will remain there until 2023 is over or for at least the foreseeable future… then right now you are being presented with the opportunity to of a life time to start piling into puts. IF you believe this is the bottom of the VIX and that much like all of 2022 we will spike back to the 2022 bear market mean which is 23.8 to 28.3 then now is your buying opportunity. I would IF you are bearish and believe the earnings, FOMC and next CPI will start a bearish catalyst and bearish dump in the markets… I would recommend some March or June puts right here… \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ua2iz7uj0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=49c2d0f3f63bb9139875fd575a9a22dd32aca288\\n\\nThat leaves me… where am I at? What is my prediction? I remain under the conviction that we will for most of 2023 and possibly even into 2024 depending on the economy, recession, FOMC, CPI, etc. etc. trade within this 375.6 to 408.8 channel… I believe we will see the occasional outlier at 360 to 428 but any touches there will be short lived. I honestly believe that the bottom IS IN… I do think that 348.11 on October 10th WAS the bottom and will remain the bottom for the foreseeable future. \\n\\nThe only thing that in my opinion would change my mind on that is IF we were to see back to back to back bearish catalysts. Bears are going to need the perfect end of January into February bear storm… they are going to need to see two weeks straight of big tech and heavily weighted companies miss on earnings AND give poor guidance, we also are going to need JPOW to have a backbone and give one last 50bps hike, after that bears need to see a rebound in CPI (especially CORE). This would be three big bearish catalysts from January 23rd until February 14th. That is 4-5 weeks of catalysts that COULD drive the narrative downward. \\n\\nIf you remember the SPY cycle above I mentioned that the final leg down of this current bear cycle would end the end of February and COULD reach as low as the 330s. \\n\\nPersonally I believe at some point we are going to get enough of a run and momentum to break through 417.74. That level is what signals that we are BACK in a bull market. However, I do not think we will just slow climb back to ATHs. I think 2023 and possibly even 2024 depending on what happens with the economy, recession, CPI, etc. etc. etc. will be very much so range bound. \\n\\nI also would not be shocked to see hedgies rally us just hard enough and just convincing enough over that bull market line to trap people in calls and pull the final downside hedges off before we finally see the last leg down put in. \\n\\nAlso you have to remember that historically the bottom bottom comes AFTER the FED pivots… While we DID slow rate hikes from 75bps to 50bps and COULD slow to 25bps here in February… we have NOT officially pivoted until we get a 0bps… That at max will come at the March 22nd meeting. That means most likely if I had to guess the last leg down will be put in during the summer of 2023. The question is will we put in a new 52 week low or will we revisit the 360s and start the recovery. \\n\\nSomething else that keeps me up at night (just kidding but it really makes me wonder) is that IF this truly is the bottom and this is truly just going to be range bound until we slowly start the next bull market… we have not had true capitulation… sure there was a few days in a row of huge sell offs in a row. Some really long streaks of red days in a row but I do not think we had capitulation. We also never got our VIX to 50+ Spike. The highest the VIX ever got was 38.94 on January 24th (very early on before we even were officially in a bear market). We also have not had a circuit breaker…. \\n\\nWhile there is no official requirement for VIX 40-50, a circuit breaker OR for capitulation (which could be seen as the VIX spiking or a circuit breaker)…. It would be very odd to see an official bear market like this without them. There was definitely some very convincing days in June that I would have thought had the potential though…. \\n\\n**Daily log-** \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxvkdzek0xba1.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=d96dbea6a79f33ac13b6901c1bcd4538411e9eec\\n\\nI unfortunately found myself on the wrong side of the news today with Tesla which of course being a 0dte resulted in a total loss. Today was my sons birthday and I was off most of the morning and by time I got back I just couldn’t find anything I really wanted to trade. Ended up taking a pretty sizeable red day today and unfortunately put my first red week of 2023 in too. \\n\\nSomethings I learned this week that I plan to implement going forward. \\n\\nThis week is now the second week in a row where I had a great Monday and Tuesday and playing a major fed event like CPI or FOMC minutes has resulted in a significant loss. I used to play every major FED day (cpi, FOMC, FOMC minutes, unemployment data, etc. etc. etc.). However, the thing I am finding to become increasingly true is that I have been correct however the market has not reacted how I envisioned it too.. For example last week I played puts on Unemployment data expecting a full on -1% red open and I got the exact numbers in order to do that… and market algos decided that for the first time ever wages were more important than overall unemployment missing by a huge shot… Just like CPI my prediction for the actual CPI numbers was damn near perfect.. however, despite playing the highest probability play I could (a strangle) the markets decided on some of the best inflation numbers we have had yet to open flat. Going forward I am going to be stepping back from playing any big data days or big fed days. The risk to reward is just not there anymore. \\n\\nWith that being said we have now reached some of the worst theta decay and IV crush that I have ever seen. \\n\\nIV crush- the one thing that an option player wants to see is HIGH IV after they are in a play… why? Because I high IV pumps premium prices AND means a huge move is expected… however, the issue lately on SPY is that the MM have priced spy options so damn well with premiums and IV that the reward side of the risk is very low. For example for the last two weeks now (especially this week) previous moves that would have netted 10-15% gains are barely netting 3-5% gains. I noticed this actually on a macro scale from about September until November previous scalps and level to level plays stopped paying as well.. Scalps used to be literal free money… as long as you had the direction correct and played the techncials correct you could net yourself a 15-20% win in literal seconds (think 3 seconds is my record)… however, now those same scalps are barely giving you 5% before premiums move against you. In addition with IV being so well priced when we do have huge data days the IV pumps so well on SPY that the move doesn’t give you anything. For example last week on that unemployment data I know some people played SPY calls and a near .8% move I believe it was on 0dte SPY contracts barely netted 30% on a swing play… a 0dte moving nearly 1% should EASILY be a 100%+ gain… \\n\\nThe only plays lately that I find to be even worth while are weekend swings… I am not quite sure why (And I would love someone to chime in here… ) but I have noticed since thanksgiving weekend that every Friday into Monday (and especially into 3 day weekends) that the next DTE after the weekend IV drops into almost the single digits… however, nearly every single day of the week SPY has opened with an IV of 25-35%. For instance tonight the IV on 1/17 SPY puts and calls closed at 8.2% and 9.9%... that is incredibly low IV considering IV should open around 25-35% on Tuesday. The best risk to reward if you have very strong conviction for a move over the weeks comes in here… If I take a swing this is what I will look for is IV near 10-13% the day before and a VERY convincing technical move… otherwise the risk to reward on swings is shit again too…\\n\\nLastly is theta decay- I noticed that pretty much since November (when 0dte everyday started) the theta decay (and mind you there are other factors here but im just saying theta cause that’s what most call it when prems lose their value) has been extremely aggressive. For instance today… we had a VERY slow bull trend all day long moving us up. But the issue was that SPY would move up 50 cents -> immediately drop 40 cents -> move up 60 cents -> immediately drop 40 cents -> move up 50 cents -> immediately drop 75 cents -> move up 80 cents… etc etc etc… what effectively ended up happening is that every time we would push favorable you barely saw on a very short DTE (anything but 0dte) any profits, however, that move against you comes and by time price moves even more favorably in your direction your contracts value is less than it was at the same spot… I have noticed for the last 4 days this is exactly how premiums have moved pretty much all day long… I have barely most days been able to get any sort of sizeable win out of anything over 2dte because of this. And if you fail to take profits on the first push you are left either getting stopped out or left with even less profits the next time. \\n\\nNow add in this theta eating movement with the fact that we are seeing IV open at 35% and slowly all day long drop down to close out under 20% and well unless you have a VERY strong aggressive trend… 99% of the time you already lost just taking a trade.\\n\\nWe are in a very tough time to trade right now and honestly I do not forsee it getting any better. We have to weigh the risk to reward every single trade… we also have to accept that unless we see a big move coming and a bigger trend to play out that honestly you might find yourself sitting out some days and not even trading them. \\n\\nIn the end its like I have said all of 2022… capital preservation is the number one goal until we truly are in our next QE fueled bull market. Until the markets slap that easy button again and we can open a 0dte at 945am in the direction of the trend and hold it with conviction until 3pm for a nice win… we are stuck in one of the hardest markets maybe ever to trade in. \\n\\nHave a good weekend guys.'}, {'text': \"I believe there is a lot of potential in Blackberry (BB).  I'm not a WSBer, but all the investing subs have blocked my posts because BB was caught up in the meme stocks, so WSB is the only place left.  This post focuses on a new product called **Blackberry Ivy**, launched in partnership with Amazon AWS.\\n\\nIf you haven’t been following BB, they no longer make phones and have transitioned to software. Their two main plays are cybersecurity and IoT, with a specific focus on QNX, a real-time operating system currently installed in 215M+ vehicles on the road.  While cybersecurity has been disappointing, QNX has been steady and shows promise.  QNX is used by 24 of the top 25 electric vehicle manufacturers (only missing Tesla) and medical/industrial equipment.  You will see articles saying QNX is being ditched for Android Automotive, but this is just for infotainment.  QNX is still in these cars for safety-critical systems and runs below Android Automotive.  To use a crude analogy, Android Automotive is like Chrome and QNX is Windows.  However, this post is on a new product, called **Blackberry Ivy**, which has no known competitor and is first-to-market.\\n\\n**What is Blackberry Ivy?**\\n\\nIvy is an auto software product that processes and standardizes sensor data both in the car and in the cloud. It allows for applications do be built more efficiently in cars and, in my opinion, will transform the auto apps market just like Apple app store or Android/Google Play did to phone apps.\\n\\nTo give just one example of what Ivy could do, imagine being a third-party app developer who wants to build an app for the auto market that recognizes when a vehicle occupant has fallen asleep, so the vehicle environment can be adjusted for a more enjoyable ride (e.g. The app would turn off air conditioning near that person, turn off volume from closest speaker, etc.). The way to determine if an occupant has fallen asleep is by using data from an inward-facing camera.  However, the auto manufacturer would never grant access to raw camera data to a third-party app developer. This is where Ivy comes in. Ivy standardizes the outputs, so you do not need the raw data. The data from the camera is sent to Ivy, where it is processed to standard outputs  (e.g. Driver = awake, Front-Passenger = awake, Rear-Right-Passenger =  asleep, etc.). The app uses these standardized outputs to create some action in the vehicle without ever seeing the actual video feed.\\n\\nAn app created with Ivy can then be used with any auto manufacturer using Ivy software, creating a  much larger app market.  A developer no longer has to make separate apps for Ford and BMW vehicles systems, he can just build his app with Ivy and that will work on any car using Ivy.  (Think how cell phones used to each create their own apps, until Android allowed them to share a common marketplace).  This is especially important for niche apps that already struggle to find a market.\\n\\nThe previous example is just a single example. There are numerous use-cases that can be described for vehicle payment systems, insurance, car maintenance, etc. with many of these already in the works. There is also tremendous potential for a consumer-focused or novelty app marketplace.  For example, Spotify could make a feature in their app that identifies the occupants and their music preferences, so the vehicle only plays songs that the most number of occupants would enjoy. That way someone who loves country music will not have to suffer through a rap playlist (e.g. In-ward facing camera sends video data to Ivy, Ivy outputs: Occupant ID: 30432493, Occupant ID: 34824492 are sent to the Spotify app, which uses an algorithm to cross-reference these IDs with playlists and finds songs both occupants would enjoy.  Spotify never has to see the raw camera data, yet it gives them a great feature for their app.  The car manufacturer benefits because they can create a better driving experience without having to spend a lot of money developing niche apps). This, of course, assumes some level of permission has been given by the occupants to be identified.\\n\\n**What is Blackberry Ivy worth in revenue?**\\n\\nBB's SAM estimate of $800M for Ivy in 2024 suggests Ivy could be worth up to $36.36/car/year (based on \\\\~20M QNX vehicles and \\\\~2M Tesla vehicles being produced in 2024).  I encourage you to do your own calculation.  Let's say Ivy is worth $10/car/year (with BB getting a 50% cut for $5/car/year).  Multiply $5/car/year by how many cars you think may adopt Ivy and be on the road for any given year (remember, BB QNX is currently installed into \\\\~20M new cars each year, with the EV market set to grow).\\n\\nIf all 215M+ cars that currently run on QNX had Ivy, that would produce $1B in revenue each year.  I  believe Ivy will eventually bring in $1B/year for BB, the question is will it take 5 year or 10 years to get there.  Keep in mind, BB’s total revenue for FY 2022 (essentially calendar year 2021) was $718M, so this  would be a significant jump in revenue.\\n\\nBB's SAM disclosure for Ivy can be found here @ 24:17 (Note: FY 2025 for BB is essentially calendar year 2024): [https://wsw.com/webcast/oppenheimer23/bb/2273700](https://wsw.com/webcast/oppenheimer23/bb/2273700)\\n\\n**What would this do to the stock price?**\\n\\nBB would now be valued more like a high growth stock. BB currently has a P/S ratio of 3.1. High growth stocks like Crowdstrike (11.6), Cloudflare (16.4), Datadog (15.0), and ZScaler (12.7) all have much higher P/S ratios. If BB were to be valued similar to these companies (e.g. P/S ratio of 15) that would put the stock price at $15.92/share just for 2024. **This target stock price does not take into account any future revenue from Ivy, only BB being valued more like a growth stock based on current revenue.**\\n\\n**Will Blackberry Ivy actually be adopted by auto manufacturers?**\\n\\nThere have been a number of recent indicators suggesting Ivy will be adopted by auto manufacturers.   Ivy is a 50/50 partnership with Amazon, but it is only in the last couple of months that Amazon AWS engineers have become more vocal about Ivy.  Sure, Amazon is involved in many ventures, but this seems different.  Ivy was featured a number of times at Amazon's re:Invent 2022 conference just a few weeks ago.  Amazon's general manager of automotive name-dropped Blackberry Ivy during a  presentation and that presentation had two other speakers: a senior vice president from Stellantis, who spoke about how Stellantis (which owns  Dodge/Fiat/Chrysler/Jeep/Opel/Peugeot/Ram/Vauxhall) is transitioning to a software-defined vehicle, and Amazon's general manager of automotive   technology, who discussed BB's QNX operating system and how Amazon was bringing it to the cloud.  Here is the presentation (Ivy name-drop after 13:00): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tse4B-fnbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tse4B-fnbI)\\n\\nThe inclusion of Stellantis in a presentation discussing BB Ivy and BB QNX is notable.  When the first live demo of Ivy was presented at Bosch ConnectedWorld 2022 in November, the vehicle used in the demo was a Peugeot, a brand owned by Stellantis (Bosch, a leading supplier for automotive, is also partnering with Ivy).  At the earnings call last week, BB announced they will be demoing Ivy at CES 2023 in a Jeep Cherokee, another brand owned by Stellantis.\\n\\n[Ivy live demo at Bosch ConnectedWorld in November](https://preview.redd.it/ldum9emvwn8a1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=519417edfdb6e37f082ad1f47fafde651d810e44)\\n\\nBB announced they hope to have the first design win for Ivy by CES on Jan 5-8 and I expect Stellantis will be the first manufacturer to sign-on to Ivy (If it's not announced at CES, the next bet would be the earnings call in March).  Stellantis' CEO will also deliver a keynote at CES.\\n\\nRe:Invent also featured another presentation on Blackberry Ivy being run by representatives from Amazon and Bosch.  That presentation was shared by two BMW engineers discussing machine learning.  One of Ivy's selling points is to better allow for machine learning models to be applied to   the data generated by the car sensors.  BMW also recently signed deals with Amazon AWS and already uses BB QNX.  Here is the presentation:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI2RwYUN92E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI2RwYUN92E)\\n\\nIt's an interesting coincidence that Stellantis and BMW are in presentations that discuss/mention BB Ivy, as well as doing public demos in Stellantis vehicles.\\n\\nThe AWS/Bosch presentation on Ivy had a very interesting slide showing companies that are already partnering with Ivy and showing some potential use-cases for Ivy:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f0o8xzuzwn8a1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c94d6b3741ce24375f0bc3c6a4ed5790035bb9a\\n\\nNotice TomTom is mentioned for location-based services.  TomTom recently announced a collaboration with Amazon, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft to create a new open map data system known as Overture Maps Foundation to counter Google Maps' dominance.  Does TomTom plan to send their own version of a Google Street View car around the world?  No.  It appears that TomTom plans to leverage the data already being collected by software-defined vehicles on the road.  How can TomTom use data from different auto manufacturers, each with their own systems?  Ivy standardizes it.  TomTom can then use the improved maps to service consumers.  Auto manufacturers bring in additional revenue selling the data collected from the vehicles and consumers get greatly improved mapping services.  Everyone wins.  And it is Ivy that facilitates this.  (Credit to [u/snoutandtruffle](https://www.reddit.com/u/snoutandtruffle/) for bringing TomTom to my attention.  I recommend reading every one of his posts about Ivy as he is the best at spotting new info, IMHO).\\n\\nBlackberry Ivy is also agnostic, meaning manufacturers don't have to use Amazon AWS cloud or BB QNX in order to use Ivy.  This gives them complete control over the data.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts:**\\n\\nI'm not here to pump and dump a stock.  I'm also not claiming BB will become a $1T company.

Equity And Volatility Markets & Trade Recommendations***\\n\\n## Outlook For Markets And Volatility\\n\\n* Until recently, it was thought that a soft landing and upturn in the economic cycle would follow the significant increase in interest rates and global geopolitical uncertainty\\n* However, this view has been abandoned due to further market and economic weakness potentially occurring as a result of central bank overtightening\\n* The outlook for the market in 2023 includes two periods: market turmoil and economic decline that will force a pivot, followed by an economic and asset recovery\\n* The timing and severity of the downturn is uncertain, but financial markets may react sooner and more violently than the economy itself\\n* The pivot, which will coincide with peak short-term rates, USD, and market volatility, will require central banks (primarily the Fed) to signal cutting rates\\n* This pivot may be prompted by economic deterioration, an increase in unemployment, market volatility, a decline in risky assets, and a decline in inflation\\n* The market turmoil and subsequent reversal may happen between now and the end of Q1 2023\\n* Risks to this view include consumer and corporate resilience pushing the downside market scenario to late 2023, or a sharp near-term decline in inflation prompting a Fed pivot without significant economic damage\\n\\n## U.S. Market Recap & Outlook\\n\\n* The VIX has averaged around 26 in 2022, up from an average of around 19.5 in 2021\\n* Volatility is expected to remain above its long-term average in 2023, with the VIX averaging around 25 in the baseline forecast scenario\\n* Volatility is expected to be biased higher in the early part of the year, as equity markets are expected to fall through this year\\'s lows\\n* The full year average will depend on the timing of central banks pivoting to an easing bias and the duration/depth of any equity market drawdown\\n* High volatility may occur in the near term, but is not expected to persist for the full year due to a shift in positioning to align with a recessionary environment having already occurred, and central banks expected to pivot to an easing bias\\n* Volatility in the equity market may also be impacted by a potential re-acceleration of monetary accommodation in response to the global economic recovery, and potentially a shift in the term premium structure of the US yield curve\\n* Volatility in the currency market may be impacted by a potential unwinding of the reflation trade, a potential shift in central bank policy, and a potential reduction in global liquidity\\n* Volatility in the fixed income market may be impacted by a potential re-acceleration of monetary accommodation in response to the global economic recovery, and a potential shift in the term premium structure of the US yield curve\\n\\n[ Average VIX vs. Short-Term Rate Levels](https://preview.redd.it/xwteodwvda8a1.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a77fb0549f9ef70d4578a608627360ddf203615)\\n\\n \\n\\n[S&P 500 E-Mini Market Depth \\\\(1-Week

outlook for risk is uncertain due to the prospect of a recession in the Euro area, energy and geopolitical uncertainty, sensitivity to the likelihood and timing of a potential US recession, and lack of clarity on China reopening\\n* The VSTOXX median level in 2022 was 27.6, higher than expectations, and similar levels are expected in 2023\\n* The Euro area is expected to enter a mild recession this winter, with the ECB expected to implement a mildly restrictive policy shift in response\\n* Political risk in Europe is expected to remain contained in the coming year, with reform efforts set on autopilot and limited event risk\\n* Inflation is expected to moderate and hit the central bank\\'s target in 2024\\n\\n## Asian Market Recap & Outlook\\n\\n* The VHSCEI traded above 40 on 30 days in 2022, driven by policy and macro surprises including strict COVID policies, rising geopolitical uncertainty, and delinquency concerns in the real estate sector\\n* The VHSCEI is expected to average 30 in 2023, down from 33 in 2022, as headwinds to China-related assets dissipate\\n* The main driver of the China macro outlook will be the economic reopening, which is expected to be a prolonged process with transitional pains\\n* Geopolitical tensions with the US are expected to remain a long-term risk factor, with interim signs of stabilization possible\\n* China\\'s unique position in the monetary policy cycle is expected to keep the local stock market relatively resilient from a slowdown in DM economies\\n* Offshore China markets are expected to remain more volatile than onshore peers, with foreign investors potentially adjusting underweight China positions in favor of Hong Kong listed equities\\n* Japan equity implied volatility rose modestly in 2022, with the VNKY averaging 22.9\\n* The VNKY is expected to remain elevated in 2023, with a target of 25, as monetary policy tightening and a slowing macro environment sustain market volatility\\n\\n# Volatility Supply And Demand\\n\\n## Impact of Rising Rates On the Equity Derivatives Market\\n\\n* Structured products in the US and Europe saw outperformance due to rising long-dated interest rates, while Asian markets and Japan saw little impact\\n* The effect of rates on structured products was particularly pronounced in the US and Europe, with little impact in most Asian markets and none in Japan\\n* The performance of long-dated, fixed-strike forwards in the US and Europe outperformed spot due to rising interest rates\\n* The changes in dividend and vega risk in the Euro STOXX 50 were relatively small compared to the peak-to-trough risk change in 2020 and the change in the HSCEI in 2021\\n* An increase in implied volatility makes autocallables more attractive and capital protected products less attractive, while an increase in forwards makes autocallables less attractive and capital protected products more attractive\\n* The relative attractiveness of each type of structured product depends on the relative changes between forwards and equity volatility\\n* The moves in rates and volatility in 2021 impacted the relative attractiveness of principal-at-risk and principal-protected structures in different markets, with principal-protected structures becoming more attractive in the US and Europe and less attractive in Asia due to rising implied volatility and unchanged forwards, while the opposite occurred in Japan due to rising forwards and unchanged implied volatility.\\n* Shift from autocallables to capital protected products should reduce the supply of long-dated skew over time, due to less selling of OTM Puts to replicate the Knock-In Barrier of the autocallables\\n\\n[Forward-to-Spot Basis

Short-Dated Volatility\\n\\n* Short-dated S&P 500 volatility was driven by supply of ATM/upside volatility and demand for downside volatility for protection in 2022 - though this flow imbalance was weaker than normal due to a variety of notable factors:\\n   * Low investor positioning throughout much of the year required less hedging demand (as you only need to hedge what you are long/overweight)\\n   * Increased demand for calls from underweight investors to hedge right tail risks (equity-replacement strategies)\\n   * Moderately lower supply from yield generation/volatility risk premium strategies given the increasing yields available from FI vehicles\\n* Dealer gamma positioning and market volatility were strongly correlated in 2022 due to weak liquidity conditions and the reinforcing effects of dealers\\' hedging flows.\\n* The decline in skew to multi-year lows was due to weak investor positioning, the popularity of put options with a volatility knock-out, and the atypical volatility environment.\\n* Skew is likely to become steep again when investors re-lever and the effect of volatility knock-out options on skew declines.\\n* Activity in volatility risk premia strategies remained subdued in 2022, after collapsing in 2020 as the COVID volatility spike led many funds to close or pare back activity\\n* Systematic variance sellers have all but disappeared, leaving convexity risk-premium trading well above pre-pandemic levels\\n\\n[Realized Volatility vs. Dealer Gamma Positioning](https://preview.redd.it/0vgoopjrea8a1.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d9484e0ee9d99e1c224534e8be0a265850b12cb)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[SPX Skew Flattened Significantly In

active in the US options market in 2022, but with slightly lower volume compared to 2021\\n* Retail traders tend to be buyers of ATM options in very short-dated maturities, but sellers in most other parts of the volatility surface\\n* Trading activity in zero day to expiry (0DTE) options has significantly grown and now makes up over 40% of total contracts traded\\n* Retail investors are not the main participants in the 0DTE options market\\n* Most 0DTE options trades are unwound before the end of the day/expiry\\n* Transaction costs in vega terms for 0DTE options are up to three times as high as longer-dated options\\n* Outright option returns for 0DTE options are highly profitable shortly after trade initiation, but delta-hedged option returns are unprofitable\\n* End users of 0DTE options are likely to be directional high frequency traders, while market makers are willing to supply liquidity due to wider bid-ask spreads and can systematically profit from delta-hedged positions\\n* The biggest impact of 0DTE options comes from the delta at inception, with a small gamma impact due to the short holding periods of these options.\\n\\n[Retail And Short-Term SPX Volume Dynamics](https://preview.redd.it/argmx600fa8a1.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4c978046fcfadc6a4a0a21e06143cb4a1dcfd87)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n## Long Dated Volatility\\n\\n* The supply/demand balance in long-dated US volatility space comes from three primary sources: insurance companies, structured products, and vol spread players\\n* In recent years, the balance between insurance demand and structured product supply has tipped towards the supply side due to decreased insurance demand and increased structured product issuance\\n* This has led to gradual pressure on long-dated S&P 500 implied volatility and dividend levels\\n* Vol spread trading activity declined significantly during the pandemic and has not recovered\\n* Insurance hedging flows have been in decline in recent years due to a number of VA issuers scaling back or closing their businesses, net flows being negative for several years, and new products being issued with less demand for hedges\\n* Long-term S&P 500 volatility demand from VA hedgers was subdued in 2022 and fell year-on-year, but there was an opportunistic demand surge late in the year as insurers reloaded on long-dated option hedges\\n* The adoption of LDTI in 2023 could lead to an uptick in insurance hedging demand, but the impact is likely to be more pronounced on the rates side than in equities\\n* The structural decline in VA hedging demand is expected to continue, with VA sales forecast to be 10% lower in 2022 than in 2021\\n* The growth in structured product issuance has led to a surplus of long-dated volatility supply\\n* Vol spread trading activity is expected to remain low in the near term, with only modest growth expected in the long term\\n* The balance between insurance demand and structured product supply is expected to continue tilting towards the supply side, leading to further pressure on long-dated S&P 500 implied volatility and dividends\\n\\n[Index And Single Stock

3M ATM SPY Put vs. Selling 1.7x the Notional in 3M ATM LQD Puts for zero net cost**\\n\\n>*\"In the US HG 2023 Outlook, JPM\\'s credit strategists forecast HG bond spreads to tighten to 155bps, in-line with the 10y average and implying nearly a 10% total return for high-quality credit, as spreads will tighten modestly even as the economy remains weak and may slip into a shallow recession. Specifically, higher quality assets with attractive yields will be in favor in 2023 and the team expects reallocations towards IG corporate credit from previously painful allocations to higher risk alternatives. Conversely, in the 2023 Global Equity Strategy Outlook, JPM\\'s equity strategists expect the S&P500 to retest this year\\'s lows in 1H23 as the Fed overtightens into weaker fundamentals. This sell-off combined with disinflation, rising unemployment, and declining corporate sentiment should be enough for the Fed to start signaling a pivot, subsequently driving an asset recovery.*  \\n>  \\n>*\"Fundamentally, we like how LQD represents the potential upside in high-quality US corporate credit, and remain comfortable selling the expensive, relative implied volatility in LQD to buy cheaper option volatility in SPY. While LQD has fallen 15% YTD, shares have rebounded just over 10% since reaching a YTD low of $99.20 in mid-October, a level LQD has not reached since before 2010. LQD shares represent a high-quality USD IG portfolio, with an average BBB+ rating, 3.7% weighted-average coupon, weighted-average duration of 8.6 years, 5.2% YTW, and a weighted-average bond holding price of around $90. LQD holds IG credits in Financials (31%), Consumer, Non-Cyclical (20%), Communications (13%), and Technology (10%). If central bankers do pivot on interest rate policy next year, investors could view LQD as an attractive alternative to play longer-term interest rates, given LQD\\'s average duration is in-line with the current 10y UST, but with a higher YTW compared to the 10y UST\\'s YTW of 3.6%.*  \\n>  \\n>*\"As S&P 500 consensus earnings fell this year, SPY shares have fallen 13% YTD, but did also rebound over 12% off October lows. However, a further decline in earnings expectations for next year, given continuing weakness in US economic conditions, will provide for increased volatility and equity downside. Contrasting LQD\\'s relative historical cheapness, the S&P 500 currently trades at nearly 20x JPM\\'s Strategists\\' estimated 2023 earnings of $205, a premium to its 10y average of 16x.*  \\n>  \\n>*\"As illustrated in the figure below, the LQD/SPY 3M Implied Volatility ratio is in its 95th percentile over the past 5 years, though only moderately above the realized volatility ratio, illustrating the relative richness of LQD implied volatility vs. SPY. As such, we recommend selling puts in LQD to fund puts on SPY, premium neutral, to position for our 2023 outlook that sees high-grade corporate credit spreads outperforming US equities into next year.*\\n\\n[Ratio Between LQD And SPX 3-Month At-the-Forward Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/b4onbz1mfa8a1.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=56c1585c970818315806b1a530e5f300f9bf6999)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Skew/Convexity Trades\\n\\n## Monetize the Rich Convexity Risk Premium\\n\\n**Convexity On The S&P 500 Is Still Trading At Distressed Levels; JPM Recommends Monetizing It**\\n\\n>*\"The implied convexity risk premium, for example measured by the spread between variance swaps and ATMF volatility, surged in early 2020 and has continued to trade at around* ***twice*** *its pre-pandemic levels over the past \\\\~2.5 years, and US indices exhibit among the highest convexity levels across major global indices. As discussed in the Volatility Supply/Demand section, the convexity richness is sustained by tail hedging demand and a dearth of Vol Risk-Premium sellers. While we don\\'t see an immediate catalyst to pressure implied convexity levels lower, selling this Risk-Premium makes for an attractive carry trade to play the Implied-to-Realized spread.*\\n\\n[1-Year Variance Less At-the-Forward Volatility \\\\(Left\\\\); Ratio of Vol vs. Var Swap \\\\(Right\\\\)](https://preview.redd.it/1soisfpsfa8a1.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b32a11116bd7f9ee347a7cf9b7cc4566dd19c02)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>*\"Therefore, we recommend monetizing the rich convexity, for example, via the following structures:*  \\n>  \\n>► ***Sell 1x Dec\\'23 Variance Swap vs. Buying 0.85x The Vega Notional In Dec\\'23 Vol Swaps On SPX***  \\n>  \\n>*\"The terminal payout (if held to maturity) is linked solely to the SPX\\'s Realized Volatility over the life of the trade, and rich convexity levels allow investors to obtain a wide breakeven range and elevated maximum payout. We ratio the two legs in order to skew the breakeven range lower. The Variance-Vol swap spread is currently indicatively bid at 3.7 points; this structure allows investors to collect a maximum 3.5 times the Vega Notional if the index realizes near 24%, and returns a positive P/L if realized volatility over the next year falls between 10% and 38%. The structure returns >2 Vega profit if realized volatility falls between 15% and 33.5%. Investors can also consider similar structures on the Russell 2000 and Nasdaq 100, where convexity is similarly rich.*  \\n>  \\n>► ***Buy Dec\\'23 50% Up-Variance vs. Selling Vanilla Variance On The SPX***  \\n>  \\n>*\"In this structure, an investor indicatively collects 1.75 Vega of annualized carry as long as the SPX trades above 50% of its starting level (i.e., above a spot price of \\\\~2000). If the SPX dips below this barrier, the investor is naked short variance at a strike of 29, only for the period the index trades below this level.*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n## Relative Value in VIX vs. SPX Tail Hedge\\n\\n>*\"We noticed previously a relative value trade opportunity between VIX and SPX 1M Skew. We apply the same analysis for 3M Skew. As of 12/5/2022, the VIX and SPX 3M Skewness, and 3M Implied and Realized Correlation are shown in the images below. We see that the 3M VIX vs. SPX Skewness difference is on the low end (8th Percentile) with a Z-Score of \\\\~1.37. Also, the implied vs. realized correlation plot shows that implied correlation is on the high end (absolute value) and the correlation spread between implied vs. realized is at around peak. Therefore, VIX Skew is rich, while SPX Skew is cheap - historically speaking. The relative value trade with short VIX OTM Call & long SPX OTM Put is recommended in the image below.*\\n\\n[Historical 3-Month Skewness For SPY And VIX](https://preview.redd.it/s7tikbz1ga8a1.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=18c0263cc84b89701ba41d54ed1006c5aa655ac6)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[3-Month Implied And Subsequent Realized Correlation Between SPX And VIX](https://preview.redd.it/7e0m7vu2ga8a1.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=9684e972c581cef45fc532cfd806220e3a4478c8)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[VIX vs. SPX Relative Value Trade Recommendation](https://preview.redd.it/2ntvql94ga8a1.png?width=1163&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c3d6b587ac836668432eb7dcb4c6becd0a2c912)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n## Machine Learning Based Dispersion Trades\\n\\n>*\"It is our long-held belief that names with extreme factor exposures are likely to experience higher volatility. One reason is that stock volatility is increasingly attributable to factor rotations, which are in-turn driven by macro factors such as bond yields. 2022 has been an eventful year for the equity market due to the hawkish turn in central bank policies globally. Without pontificating on the future direction of bond yields, we believe that factor driven equity volatility is likely to be sustained for the foreseeable future.*  \\n>  \\n>*\"In this section, we propose a new SPX Dispersion Portfolio constructed using our machine learning based methodology.*  \\n>  \\n>***SPX Bespoke Dispersion***  \\n>  \\n>*\"We propose the following SPX dispersion portfolio, selected from an expanded universe of S&P members with the highest option liquidity.

JPM\\'s Equity Strategists believe that the most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in decades will cause fundamentals to deteriorate next year, driving a significant fall in corporate earnings as the economy enters recession, labor markets contract, and consumers and corporates cut discretionary spending and capital investments. This is likely to cause markets to draw down early next year, before rallying later in the year once central banks pivot to finish the year moderately higher (\\\\~5%).*  \\n>  \\n>***S&P 500 OTM Puts***  \\n>  \\n>*\"S&P 500 Skew has come down sharply this year as low positioning reduced the demand for downside hedges and higher rates/volatility lowered the supply of call overwrites (See the Volatility Supply/Demand Section). Meanwhile, sharply higher short-term rates this year have shifted forwards higher, cheapening the cost of OTM Puts (as options are priced relative to the forward, not the spot level). Thus, despite the high macro risks, pricing of OTM Vanilla Puts is relatively inexpensive thanks to these technical factors - for example, the premium to buy a 3M 95% Put on the S&P 500 is in just its 30th percentile relative to the last 3 years of history. Investors should therefore look to put on hedges given the weak outlook for markets, while taking advantage of the historically flat skew and high forwards by buying OTM Puts, which price well in this environment. Investors can consider for example:*  \\n>  \\n>*►****Buy SPX 3M 95% Puts for 2.15% of Notional; Indicatively...***\\n\\n[SPX 3-Month 95&#37; Put Premium](https://preview.redd.it/s1df7fmtga8a1.png?width=559&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cf4ef024632d57eda79e746619540b07b47f691)\\n\\n♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥\\n\\n***Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays Everyone - I Hope You\\'re All Having A Great Time With Your Loved Ones And Are Ready To Hit The Ground Running In \\'23!***\\n\\n♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥\\n\\n***♠ Follow Me → More To Come On Flows & Derivatives ♠***\\n\\n♠ ***Cheers!*** ♠'}, {'text': 'Hello WSB, as promised from this evening\\'s Uranium Cage Match, here is my uranium sector DD. In this discussion I will be exploring the uranium sector as a whole, where things currently stand, what uranium is , what it\\'s used for, why uranium has a good setup for the future and how you can get into uranium should you choose to. I\\'ve been looking into this sector for over a year now and have done more hours of research than I could count. Before I get into anything I want to emphasize THIS IS A LONG TERM PLAY. This is not about buying weekly calls, this is not a squeeze. This is an investment in a growing sector that should provide significant returns in the next few years. But these returns could be massive and it is by far my highest conviction play. Uranium is the one trade I will comfortable say isn\\'t a question of IF I\\'m going to make money, it\\'s WHEN I\\'m going to make money, and if you know me you\\'ll know I don\\'t make such bold statements. Alright let\\'s begin.\\n\\n**Uranium, what is it and why should I care?**\\n\\nMany of you have probably heard of uranium. It\\'s that green glowing rock that kills you if you go near it and makes a Godzilla right? Nope. First, it\\'s brown not green. Second, it\\'s actually not very radioactive out of the ground. It needs a bunch of stuff done to it before it becomes that glowing stick thing you see on The Simpsons. For those interested, here\\'s a [How It’s Made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4b4MTCvsRA) episode showing uranium from mining to being turned into nuclear fuel rods. But how it\\'s made isn\\'t as important as its use, a fuel source. Uranium is used to power nuclear powerplants. Plain and simple, that\\'s its use. And before you go \"Pfft nuclear is dead, waste of time.\" understand nuclear is actually more important than you realize. As of today, the [USA gets 18% of it\\'s electrical generation from nuclear](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3). Yes 18%. That\\'s not a small amount at all. And globally nuclear accounts for [10% of global electrical generation](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/data-and-statistics.php). So the idea that nuclear is dead isn\\'t correct. It\\'s too important right now to be dead. Unless you think the world is going to just go into full blackouts, nuclear globally isn\\'t being shut down in the next decade no matter how badly some nations want to. You need only look at Germany to see the results of that. They went all out shutting down reactors starting in 2011. It\\'s now 2022 and they just finished turning off the final reactor. 11 years for them to replace their nuclear, and they\\'re having energy issues from it. So don\\'t tell me the USA is going to shut down it\\'s nuclear and replace it with wind and solar in a few years. It\\'s just too complicated for the USA to replace 18% of its entire electrical generation no matter how much wind and solar is built (I actually like wind and solar mind you.).\\n\\nOn top of being a major energy source nuclear is carbon neutral. [Nuclear and wind have the lowest carbon generation per kWh, 70 times less than coal](https://energy.utexas.edu/news/nuclear-and-wind-power-estimated-have-lowest-levelized-co2-emissions) . Not only is it low carbon, it\\'s highly energy efficient. [One uranium fuel pellet will generate as much energy as one ton of coal, 149 gallons of oil or 1700 cubic feet of natural gas](https://www.nei.org/fundamentals/nuclear-fuel). What this means, you can store a ton of energy in a small space using nuclear. For the USA that might not matter, but for nations like Japan that don\\'t have as much space, being able to store years of energy in just a few warehouses is significant.\\n\\nPast the efficiency, nuclear is a baseload energy source unlike wind and solar. This means it generates consistent amounts of reliable electricity 24/7. Wind and solar can\\'t do this. Sometimes it\\'s not as windy. Sometimes it\\'s not as sunny. This matters because if you\\'re building an electrical grid, you need a certain amount of it to be providing a consistent predictable amount of energy. Otherwise, you risk blackouts at certain periods. Electrical grids NEED baseload energy in order to ensure the lights stay on. Add in you can control how much electricity nuclear generates. Maybe it’s really sunny, you can have the nuclear powerplant spin down and produce less and rely more on solar that day. When it’s cloudy you can then go back to using the nuclear reactors at higher capacity. And unlike wind and solar, you can build a powerplant anywhere. Wind has to be somewhere with consistently high wind, solar somewhere that has consistently high solar activity. Nuclear can be put wherever there’s space.\\n\\n**Downsides of nuclear.**\\n\\nWhile nuclear has many upsides there are of course downsides. Let\\'s start with the giant radioactive elephant in the room. NUCLEAR MELTDOWNS!!! OMG so scary right? They happen and then millions of people die and stuff. Except that\\'s not exactly true. People are familiar with 3 major meltdowns, Chernobyl, Fukushima and 3 mile island. Let\\'s do the easy one first. [3 mile island had a grand total of 0 deaths or injuries](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-facts-know-about-three-mile-island). I\\'ll say that again. 0 people were injured or died from 3 mile island. Nobody. Not just that but they got the leak under control quickly. But that isn’t a fun news story like “Powerplant leaking radiation, you’ll die if you don’t tune in NOW!!!” so it’s not the story that was told. Now onto Chernobyl. Yes people died, and the nearby land was ruined. However, this was a very special case. See, the USSR really didn\\'t give a damn about the people of Ukraine (hey history is repeating) when they build Chernobyl. Like at all. They wanted energy generation and skipped pretty much ALL safety regulations. Yes it was bad, but nobody will ever be allowed to build a powerplant that unsafe and unregulated ever again because of it. This was less nuclear bad and more neglecting any form of safety measures for any powerplant bad. Finally we have Fukushima. Yes a big scary disaster. [But like 3 mile island nobody died from the meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster_casualties#:~:text=According%20to%20a%202012%20Yomiuri,the%20crippled%20Fukushima%20nuclear%20plant.). Now people died from the tsunami. But there were no recorded deaths from radiation exposure. There are some “projected” deaths from exposure that could cause cancer later. But that’s entirely theoretical. In reality that meltdown, despite again the news telling you it was the worst thing ever, has directly killed 0 people to this day. Add in it took a historically large earthquake AND the powerplant regulators ignoring a key safety measure, moving the generators off the bottom floor, which they had been told to do for years. I don\\'t want to downplay these events but they\\'re not the world ending disasters the news likes to pretend they were. In fact, nuclear has the one of the lowest [death per KWh of any energy source](https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy) but again it doesn’t make a good news story so why would you ever hear about that? Add in new nuclear powerplants being much safer and having many fail safes. (Fun fact, Fukushima was actually OLDER than Chernobyl). Take the Zaporizhzhia nuclear powerplant in Ukraine. Russia recently bombed this powerplant during an assault. Everyone was freaking out. Know what happened? Nothing. Why? Because nuclear powerplant reactors are build with a protective core designed to take a [DIRECT impact from a fully fueled 767](https://bigthink.com/the-present/nuclear-power-plant-survive-9-11-airplane-attack/) and yes they have actually conducted this exact experiment so it’s not just in theory. They\\'re a lot safer than people realize.\\n\\nNext downside, the cost. Nuclear powerplants are EXPENSIVE to build and a lot of companies don\\'t want to build them. It takes 10 years of operating for a powerplant to just break even. That\\'s a scary investment and a lot of companies won\\'t do it. But there are new powerplants being built. The US recently has 2 new powerplants finish in Georgia and is working on extending the lifetime of current powerplants including Diablo Canyon, the last powerplant in California which the governor has requested a 20 year life extension for and it looks like he\\'s going to get it. That\\'s right, even super green California is now changing their tune about nuclear. But it\\'s not just the USA. Germany has started talking about delaying the shutdown of their remaining powerplants (They probably won\\'t, but the fact Germany is even willing to discuss the idea shows a huge sentiment shift.) Japan\\'s new ruling party has made restarting their nuclear fleet (shut down since Fukushima) a top priority with [plans for several reactors to come back online by summer 2023](https://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Japan-Plans-To-Restart-Seven-Nuclear-Reactors-By-Summer-2023.html#:~:text=Japan%20Plans%20To%20Restart%20Seven%20Nuclear%20Reactors%20By%20Summer%202023,-By%20ZeroHedge%20%2D%20Sep&text=Japan%20shutdown%20its%20nuclear%20plants,by%20the%20summer%20of%202023.). India, South Korea, Romania, France all have plans for new reactors. Even Bill Gates is working in Wyoming on creating new safer small modular reactors (SMRs). Then there\\'s China. [China has committed to building 150 new reactors](https://www.energymonitor.ai/sectors/power/weekly-data-chinas-nuclear-pipeline-as-big-as-the-rest-of-the-worlds-combined#:~:text=This%20is%20about%20to%20change,over%20the%20past%2035%20years.) over the next decade. Yes 150 reactors or 15 reactors a year. Simply put, nuclear isn\\'t going away and even seems to be growing now. Even Gretta Thunberg has come out in favor of nuclear.\\n\\nBut what about all that nuclear fuel? Surely the spent fuel rods are a problem right? I mean everyone says we can’t store them and they’ll melt your face. Except there’s not nearly as much of it as you think. All the nuclear fuel generated in the USA, one of the largest users of nuclear on the planet, would fit inside of a [single football field and only be 10 feet deep](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-fast-facts-about-spent-nuclear-fuel). Yep, just one football field to store all the spent nuclear fuel ever generated by the USA since they started having power plants in the 1950’s. The reality is every dangerous thing you’ve heard about nuclear is the result of a very carefully planned ad campaign put out by oil and gas companies who were terrified nuclear would replace them and set out to [fund multiple anti nuclear movements.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2016/07/13/are-fossil-fuel-interests-bankrolling-the-anti-nuclear-energy-movement/?sh=6c3c3d077453) I want to be clear, I am by no means saying nuclear is perfect. But there has been a lot of money spent to convince you it’s a lot more dangerous than it is, and if I wanted to I could make major cases against any energy source and the dangers it possesses. Heck you drive in cars that are literally filled with explosive gasoline that your engine constantly blows up in tiny controlled explosions that could 100% kill you if they got out of control. We just don’t describe cars like that because it’s a silly dramatization of the reality. But that’s exactly how nuclear is presented.\\n\\n**Ok so nuclear will exist, who cares.**\\n\\nSo we\\'ve established two things, nuclear currently exists at a level too large to shut down anytime soon AND places aren\\'t just not shutting it down, they\\'re adding even more. Now we get to the money part. See that uranium used to power a nuclear powerplant, it has a problem. It\\'s too cheap. How cheap? Today uranium sells for $[52/pound](https://twitter.com/numerco). But it costs a mining company $65-$70/ pound to mine it. Yes, companies currently lose $14-$18/pound mining uranium. But why would they mine it if they\\'re losing money is probably your question. Well, for most companies, they\\'re not. They have shut down all mining and are waiting for prices to go higher. This has created a major deficit in supply. [Currently, 190 million pounds of uranium are used per year globally while only 140 million pounds are mined](https://www.virginiauranium.com/uranium-101/uranium-market-u-s-uranium-sources/#:~:text=Only%20freshly%2Dmined%20uranium%20may,a%2050%2Dmillion%20pound%20deficit.). That\\'s a 25% yearly supply deficit that has been going on for 3 years now. Now you might ask how is that possible. To understand this you need to understand first how long it takes to convert uranium into a fuel rod. This process takes between 18-24 months to complete. For this reason reactors have to keep a large amount of nuclear fuel, in different forms, on hand. On average they’ll have about 2 years worth of fuel on site, some ready to user right away, some a few months away from being usable, some needing nearly the full 2 year cycle. This secures them supply should something go wrong with their expected delivery. Well remember 2011 when Fukushima hit? Japan shut down all their nuclear powerplants with no restart date. Powerplants that were now sitting on 2 years or more of fuel they were never going to use. Guess what they did with that fuel? They sold it and this created a brand new uranium market. Not only was the market flooded with cheap uranium, but traders could now buy uranium to resell to utilities at much lower prices than a mine could. They didn’t have all the CapEX of running a mine and staffing it. They just needed to pay for storage until they could deliver it to a utility. This destroyed the price of uranium. Just look at the chart below showing uranium price starting in 2011.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z6u898cnls1a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9752065d3ff1efb20bedaf00935e1e1aed27a45\\n\\nSee that giant price drop from $50 down to a low of under $20? That\\'s all that Japanese supply flooding the market. But that was over a decade ago. That supply is running out. Not only is it starting to run out, Japan is restarting their reactors as stated above, meaning they\\'re going from a net seller to a buyer of uranium. All that cheap supply utilities could buy up is disappearing, and all the traders are running out of supply to resell. And this isn’t just in theory, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yiq2jVZ5Gtc). It is an interview with the man who manages nuclear fuel buying for several utilities. In it he says starting this year he is havng more trouble than he’s had in a long time finding supply. Orders he used to get done in months now would take him near a year. And when the uranium supply starts to run low the price moves up and moves fast. Let\\'s see another graph. from 2007.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aq8r6lunls1a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=18e8dda24fb43b5f9e20951c3a86a715afdffbf4\\n\\nSee that giant price spike? That\\'s from supply going away. Specifically, from the USA ending their program of decommissioning nuclear weapons which gave a cheap supply of uranium for powerplants to buy. That same thing is about to happen in the uranium sector. All the cheap Japanese uranium has been bought and they\\'re done selling. The traders are having a harder and harder time finding new supply to resell. This is going to cause another price spike and the mining companies are going to thrive. See, as stated earlier, most of these companies are not mining. What this means is they\\'re sitting waiting for the price to get to a level worth mining and then they\\'ll start selling. Now, in the uranium sector selling is done through a contract with utilities. Usually these contracts are signed for 10 years with a price range. A bottom price so the mines don\\'t get screwed and a top price so utilities don\\'t get screwed. As of today, most companies don\\'t have any contracts, but as the supply runs out utilities are going to be forced to talk to the miners and sign these long term contracts. And this isn\\'t just theoretical. Cameco (CCJ) the 2nd largest uranium mining company in the world announced in January they had signed 40 million USD in new contracting that month which was more than they did for the entire year of 2021. Previously closed down US mines from are being restarted this year with plans to deliver into recently signed contracts starting in summer of 2023. And as these contracts come it’s going to ramp up. Because the uranium sector has one other key thing. It\\'s small. Tiny. How small? The entire uranium sector has a market cap less than that of Hersheys. Yes the chocolate company has a larger market cap than all the uranium mining companies combined. Not only is the sector tiny, you can count on two hands ALL the companies currently able to mine uranium. And as for the ones trying to build a mine? The fastest ones expect to be running in 2024 AT BEST. Here\\'s another chart for you.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/do3gwzkols1a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca5154dc5b290c0663a1f42de314af2bb7cdb156\\n\\nThis chart shows the total projected uranium mining compared to the demand out to 2040. See that red space above? That\\'s a deficit where demand beats out supply. Here\\'s the thing about this chart. It assumes a full restart of ALL existing mines AND ALL planned uranium mines. Yes. Even if every single mine and planned mine came online on time with full production there would still be a huge deficit. And uranium mines do not have near a 100% start rate. More like a 10% chance for a company to go from discovering uranium to actually getting a functioning mine. And understand something about uranium, it is an inelastic fuel. You can\\'t substitute anything for uranium. Either you have it OR you can\\'t run your power plant. And not running isn\\'t an option as it costs [$1.2 million per day to shut down a reactor](https://www.powerengineeringint.com/decentralized-energy/equipment-technology/offline-reactor-costing-edf-1-2m-per-day/). Utilities can and will pay huge amounts to get their fuel supply. This is because uranium is a fraction of the cost of a powerplant. It accounts for just 5% of their operational costs. That\\'s it, so a powerplant can have the price of uranium shoot up and see minimal impact. The analogy I like to use, think of a steak dinner. The steak is what\\'s expensive. Now do you put salt on the steak? Sure. But do you care what the salt costs? If tomorrow salt did a 10X on price would you stop eating steak? No, because salt is dirt cheap so who cares what it costs. The same holds for uranium. And even if the price goes through the roof, governments will subsidize before they allow blackouts. Because that\\'s what the entire uranium sector really boils down to. Uranium sells for too little to the point where one of two things must happen. Either the price of uranium will go up to at least $65-$70/pound to get mines back online OR when you flick a light switch in the USA in 5 years, the lights will not work. That\\'s the bet you\\'re making, which one do you think is more likely to happen.\\n\\n**Sprott and uranium.**\\n\\nI\\'m going to take a quick second to talk about one other factor in the uranium sector. Sprott. For those of you unfamiliar, Sprott is a resource investment fund run by a man named Eric Sprott. He runs large physical funds that let investors buy shares which he then uses to buy physical gold or silver. Very simple system. You buy some shares, he buys some gold. You can sell your shares or ask for payment of gold in an amount equal to your shares. Well, he\\'s doing this exact same thing for uranium (minus the delivery part, sorry guys you can\\'t get uranium sent to your home.) The system is the same, you buy shares his company uses that money to buy physical uranium which they store in a warehouse. But here\\'s the thing, this is not a resell system. Sprott gets paid per transaction, they buy an amount and keep 1% of the purchasing fee for themselves. That\\'s how they make money. They DO NOT resell this uranium, in fact, there currently is no system to resell the uranium in place. What this means, there is a system in place currently taking in millions of pounds of uranium off the market that will not resell. This takes a deficit and adds even MORE pressure since now Sprott is buying up supply from utilities. Additionally, this added something the uranium market desperately needed, price discovery. For the longest time the SPOT market was kept at very low prices as uranium was seldom traded, but Sprott brought a consistent uranium buyer to the market. When they came in uranium was trading at $30/pound. Through their bids the price now sits at $50/pound. They helped create a consistent bidder keeping the SPOT price at realistic levels that reflect the true market, not depressed levels traders used to better negotiate short term deals.\\n\\n**So what do I do?**\\n\\nAh the big question, what do you do with this information. Well, you find uranium miners you like and buy shares or LEAPs (at least 1 year out though ideally 2). Why? Because this is a very simple play, the price of uranium must go up or the lights will go out and there’s no way the world is choosing the lights going out. So the question is not IF the price of uranium will go up to AT LEAST match the inventive price and get mines back online. Rather the question is WHEN will the price go up. So you play the miners and wait because at some point we will see utilities rushing to secure supply and when that happens these miners are going to rocket with it. Now a couple of things to understand. Because this sector is so small it can rocket but those rockets go both ways. When money is flowing in stocks can jump quick. But, when money flows out when, oh I don\\'t know, the entire stock market is selling off, money flows out quickly too. And that\\'s exactly what happened to uranium over the last summer. It\\'s was selling off hard. Not too shocking as summer is often a historically bad time for uranium. Utility COEs are on vacation and won’t be thinking about supply until mid October when nuclear fuel conferences are held. Recently the stocks have been doing better, but there’s one thing you can trust in a uranium market before it launches. It’ll give you a couple good fake out runs, but it’s also really good at giving you a few fake out dumps too. I would not be shocked if some of these companies saw a 20%+ drop before a true bull market began. Because tiny markets can be sold off real quick, especially if retail gets scared while the bigger players sit back and wait for deals. I would not throw all my cash into this trade at once. Rather I would slowly scale in. Pick what you like and position, but be prepared to have to handle a few big pull backs. Take a look at this company\\'s stock movement over the last uranium bull market.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/de2qcrepls1a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=72a9767eb8acd0935c85dd249cd66edfddba11ee\\n\\nThere’s a lot of big up periods, but there’s also some nasty down swings. But in the end it gave a 50X return on the investment. But would you have made it there? Or would you have sold in March after a -42% stock move? Or maybe the 2nd sell off in April of -40%? Because that’s the thing about this market. If you’re gonna play you better be prepared for some real pain along the ride. Or try and swing trade it if you want, just know when it launches up it’s fast and you can easily be left behind.\\n\\n**Quick notes.**\\n\\nJust a quick addressing of some things I tend to hear asked. Throium reactors are a thing being worked on, but they aren\\'t ready yet and won\\'t be for decades. Even when done they can\\'t do a 100% uranium replacement overnight it\\'ll take years. I like them but it\\'s future tech. Fusion is also being worked on but that\\'s even further out future tech. It\\'s been \"20 years away\" for 50 years now. Yes wind and solar exist. I like them. I think they\\'re great. But as of today, they are energy that needs to exist with nuclear not replace it. The tech again just isn\\'t there yet. Yes new companies can build a uranium mine and uranium isn\\'t that rare. Heck you can mine uranium from sea water, and companies have a way to do it, if uranium hits $200 a pound that is. However, building a mine is a long and difficult process, especially to get permits. Most nations are very strict about allowing a company to mine uranium because of what it is. As such, you need to show not just you know how to mine it, you can do it safely and without impacting the environment. That can take near 10 years and often takes that long if not longer. So yeah, when prices spike new companies will pop up, but they\\'ll be a decade or more out from actually mining anything and this assumes they can even find staff who know how to run a uranium mine, which is not easy to find and get permits.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the gist of the uranium sector and why I feel it\\'s a good place to park some money for the next few years. It\\'s got a good future to it, it\\'s not going anywhere and in fact, shows strong signs of growing and it\\'s needed.\\n\\n**TLDR**: Uranium accounts for 18% of US electrical generation. It costs mines $65 to mine and only sells for $52, so companies aren’t mining causing a deficit. For this reason one of two things will happen. Either the price of uranium will go up to meet the incentive price turning mines back on and making up the deficit or in 5 years the USA will no longer have working lights. Unless you’re betting on the blackouts you should be bullish on uranium.\\n\\nCCJ: 283 shares.\\n\\nDNN: 900 shares, 10 1/19/2024 $1C’s, 17 1/19/2024 $1.50C’s\\n\\nBelow Market Cap Company (Message me for the name): 1,400shares\\n\\nBelow Market Cap Company (Message me for the name): 2,000 shares'}, {'text': 'Agilent Technologies, Inc is a life sciences company that provides instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire lab workflow.

I might add that EPS is up 71% for Q421. They also run a repurchasing program. Most likely the Q422 EPS will be at 4.2, from there growing steadily at \\\\~5% y/y.

Then SPY broke Tuesday’s low solidly and formed a clear intraday down trend. On the daily chart, SPY is at equilibrium now. Just watch $368.79 on the downside and the short-term resistance should be around $390.

On the weekly chart, DIA is forming a double bottom since March, while the pattern is not confirmed until it breaks the high on Aug.16th. However, if we scroll back a little more, DIA’s weekly chart is forming a rounded top. Whether to go long or short, it depends on traders’ attitude towards the market. \\n\\nXLF\\n\\nThe financial industry met previous expectation and made a price correction, it has a strong resistance above $34 since 09/12. XLF closed back in equilibrium area, pay attention to how it reacts to the upper band of the equilibrium area.\\n\\nXLI\\n\\nXLI also experienced a price correction, but unlike XLF, XLI is still extended on the upside.

Although it dropped 1.82% during the first 5 min, TSLA then rally back to $195.85, breaking Tuesday’s high but failed to fill the breakaway gap on Tuesday. On the daily chart, TSLA made a new low for the last two years and broke the pivot point $179.83, which was the low on 03/05/2021.

No more dead spots.\\n \\nI could talk for hours of the benefits and desirability of this service, the adressable market of billions, their partnerships and MOUs for distribution through cell-phone service providers, their 2400 patents, their amazing CEO and how he personally funded ASTS' beginnings, the marvels of technology they have built, how stupidly faster than GSAT IRDM AAPL and starlink it will be, how they launched yesterday their first satellite and are about to demonstrate their tech in the coming weeks, etc., but I'm going to take you by the sentiments. *Let's talk money*.\\n \\nASTS plans to deploy 168 sats. Sats will cost somewhere around 16M and launches 5M. Each sat will be able to give 1.8M GB per month. \\n \\n*Yes, but how much is a GB of space internet worth?* I hear you ask?\\n \\nWell I kid you not, Globalstar and Iridium are managing to sell their GB for more than *2000$* a pop. That's fucking right. And they're slow af, not even comparable.\\n \\nNow, for the sake of pessimism (🌈🐻), let's imagine ASTS and their partners decide to sell at a much lower price and ASTS gets half. Say 20$ per GB, so ASTS gets 10$. And again for the sake of pessimism (🌈🐻), let's say they sell only 10% of their capacity.\\n \\nOnce the full constellation is up (likely before 2030) that means a yearly revenue of 10$x168satsx1.8M GBx12 monthsx10% = **3.63B$**\\n\\nYeah, *that's fucking right* **.** My 🌈🐻 case is 3.63B$ per year for a constellation that will cost about the same only once to build. They may *very well* be able to sell *a lot more* at a *much higher* price. I'll let you do the math and come up with stupidly high valuations by yourselves.\\n \\nIf we give that a 10 years valuation that's 36B$. Currently stock is trading at 10.76$ with a 1.97B$ market cap. \\n \\nThat means a 2030 share price of **196.7$** or 18.3 times today's price share.\\n \\nSo here's the bet. **>**18.3x in 8 years if ASTS succeeds, or zero if they fail.\\n \\nPosition: Long shares, warrants, 2024 leaps, and other calls.\\n \\nDisclosure: Forward looking statements, Not financial advice, Do your own DD, don't trust strangers on the internet, Gambling is risky, yaddi yaddi yadda.\\n \\nNote: For those curious to learn more check out r/ASTSpacemobile\"}, {'text': 'Well ReRards I will keep this simple and update my position.

Certainly a company this good has procedures for verifying, checking, checking again, confirming, visiting the sites in question, examining documents, etc.... Especially dealing with the public money... So they were completely fooled? Looked away? Didn\\'t want to know? Who knows. **I make no inference from this other than to repeat the facts that IIPR is stating themselves... The money is gone, tenant is not paying and is going to dispute the case.**  \\n\\nThis was the Executive Chairman Alan Gold comment on the matter;\\n\\n  “Thank you, Brian, and welcome, everyone. I know one of the biggest questions for today\\'s calls has to do with Kings Garden and what happened. To recap, Kings Garden leased six properties. The total base rent of which was approximately $5.5 million for the second quarter or approximately 8% of our base rents collected for the quarter.\\n\\nOf these six properties, four were operational with a ground up expansion project also at one of those properties, which we will call the 19 Street expansion. The other two properties were in development or redevelopment, Bridge Street and Inland Center Dr. On July 13th, Kings Garden defaulted on their lease obligations and on July 14th, we filed an 8-K regarding that default. Later in July, we filed a suit with the state court asking for immediate access to our properties among other demands.\\n\\n**Today, Kings Garden remains in default and on August 2nd, we amended our suit making further claims regarding construction at the properties, among other things.** Okay that is what happened. And unfortunately, we will not be able to answer any questions regarding the legal proceedings. I ask for your understanding”. \\n\\nWell....I think that\\'s just a tad bit of an understatement and clearly nobody went and pulled this document from the County Clerk to ask any questions....

She\\'s never sold shares of LMEFF/LME.V and remains the primary shareholder.\\n\\nIn 2021, Canada imposed new [corporate stock taxation laws](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/whats-new-corporations.html), creating a $200,000 tax rate exemption of the difference between the exercise and fair market price upon the option being exercised. By exercising her options now rather than post buyout, the CEO will only pay capital gains tax (which is lower than personal income tax) on the profits generated from the buyout.\\n\\n*Hypothesis -* They reached their 10 million GEO target earlier than anticipated and are ready to be bought out, their CEO sold long term options to reduce taxation, and the AGM is later than usual because they’ve negotiated buyout conditions. A buyout will be announced shortly after the “record date” on August 19th.\\n\\n**Buyout Price Projection**\\n\\nOn July 11, 2022 Great Bear Resources was [acquired by Kinross Gold](https://www.kinross.com/news-and-investors/news-releases/press-release-details/2022/Kinross-completes-acquisition-of-Great-Bear-Resources/default.aspx#:~:text=In%20aggregate%2C%20Kinross%20will%20pay,Bear%20securityholders%20under%20the%20Arrangement) for $200/oz. Most of their mineralization was at depths greater than 1800m, making it difficult to access.\\n\\nLMEFF/LME.V has at least 10 million Gold Equivalent Ounces (GEO’s) at a [685m depth](https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/1263-tsx-venture/lme/119693-laurion-extends-the-a-zone-to-700m-towards-the-southwest-and-intercepted-1-21-g-t-au-and-6-40-zn-over-8-70-m.html#:~:text=About%20LAURION%20Mineral%20Exploration%20Inc.&text=The%20mineralization%20on%20Ishkoday%20is,past%20producing%20Sturgeon%20River%20Mine), which is easier to access and more valuable.\\n\\n*Conservative estimate:* Their requirement for an all-cash deal or a market downturn could lead to a similar price per ounce (PPO) as Great Bear Resources.\\n\\nWith 10 million Gold Equivalent Ounces (GEO’s), they\\'d receive a $2 billion cash offer. And with about 250 million owned shares, the buyout price would be $8.00/share.\\n\\n*Optimistic estimate:* If they receive $300/oz for 12-15 million GEO\\'s, they’d receive a buyout price of $10.00-14.00/share\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nLMEFF/LME.V has stable leadership, finances, a track record of success, and value as the stock increased by 2.33% over the last 6 months. This makes it a secure short-term hold.\\n\\nAdditionally, their CEO announced an all cash buyout as a long term goal, is selling shares despite the company potentially reaching their 10 million GEO goal, and is hosting an AGM later than usual with a shareholder vote. This indicates that a buyout could be happening soon. If it happens, shareholders may receive an 800-1400% return.\\n\\nFinally, during their AGM, they’ll announce their drilling programs’ results, including that of the diamond drilling program, which was the catalyst for their 727% growth over the last 15 months.\\n\\n**How to Buy**\\n\\nShares must be purchased before the August 19th \"record date\" to be considered for potential dividends or buyout distributions.\\n\\nThere are 2 dates that this stock should be held until: September 7th and October 1st.\\n\\nOn September 7th, they’ll release the itinerary for the AGM, which will be held on the 28th. This will verify if a buyout will happen, unless a press release was released sooner.\\n\\nOn October 1st, they will have released their drilling programs’ results and it will have impacted the share price.\\n\\n**Note:** This is not financial advice.

Instead what you will be getting is general piece of advice regarding the “Stock Market \\'\\' as whole through this fictional story that I\\'m about to share with you. So If you guys are busy and don\\'t have much time then i advise you to just skip this post. This post is just not for you. I won\\'t mind at all honestly. So without any further due. Let us begin.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n \\n\\n**Hello Everyone,**\\n\\n**Respected Traders and Investors** \\n\\nLong time no see. As you all know, I have been kicked out of my mom’s house. But I never told you guys the reason why. The thing that I\\'m about to tell you is kinda shocking and a secret. So promise me that you won\\'t tell anybody. I\\'m counting on you guys that this stays b/w us.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Depressionary books of all time](https://preview.redd.it/jan3dd6jsbe91.png?width=1801&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac4eff6f83fff001c6ed9ee87928000927aef8d7)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs you all know I\\'m kinda a massive bear in the stock market thinking the world is about to go into a forgotten depression ( if not Great Depression. 95 yr of cycle ) which would be written in some book about after we complete this fourth turning. Whether its \"Stagflationary\" or \"Deflationary\" one remains the case to be seen. But currently the market is projecting it to be deflationary one. So I don\\'t wanna hear any complaints from any of you that you weren\\'t able to buy long term bonds with hedge funds last month. No complaints. Period. I gave you the date and you just had to buy it b//w May 15-June 15. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[This was the chart in case you have forgotten. Old viewers know this :\\\\)](https://preview.redd.it/w6pofzavsbe91.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0135819161120ed7aec45f577fa096528f8dcbba)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo moving forward. Since i’m so bearish i wanted to go meet somebody who is just the polar opposite of me being pessimist bear. The man had to be someone who had been investing in the high inflation kind of environment and who outperformed the market when the market rebounded sharply from being a bear market to bull market. Yes my friends i built a time machine in my mom\\'s basement. xD\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Finding the period.](https://preview.redd.it/lzec8747tbe91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=856c794c85c0702d8577960ff8a64a7bd1635b74)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis type of scenario happened in 1920-21, 1948-50, 1975-1976. Since my machine cannot go so far into the past because it would consume a lot of electricity and power. I just don\\'t wanna pay high energy prices. I am also quite worried about a global energy crisis so I thought why not cut my trip short and meet anyone from 1970\\'s stagflation. The second half of the 70\\'s decade when the market began to turn. I wanted to meet someone who beat the market during this time. This man is someone you must have read stories about from your ancestors, associates or probably in the books. This man is none another than “Peter Lynch” His fund Magellan outperformed the market during the second half period of stagflation when market rebounded. The other guy who was a close second during this time was Warren Buffet but he is still alive and we can track his investments if we ever wanna know how to invest in a bear market. “Just buy Oil stocks\\'\\' he says” But if you do your own research you would know he was the winner in the first half of the 70\\'s decade. So in general he was good too. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Peter Lynch vs Warren Buffet](https://preview.redd.it/7amjgdabube91.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7031205efacc7c222d5cbf25d947f8a86ea84a8f)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo i was building this time machine that will let me travel in the past to meet my man Peter Lynch. Once the machine worked successfully I wasted no time jumping right in and reached the period after the turmoil had long been over somewhere b/w 1991-92. It was a cold rainy night. He just came back to his home after working late hours in the office. At first i hesitated thinking what his reaction would be but then i thought f%#k it. Let’s just ring the doorbell. Then came the footsteps approaching and there he was the man himself, whom I admire the most. I just don’t know why I was shaking a lot. So as he came by i immediately greeted him at first and said “Hello sir”. I have come from the future of 2022 and I wanted some help regarding the investing world. The man didn\\'t even flinch and said “Huh, Okay”. It was like he knew that one day people from the future would invent a time machine or he just thinks that maybe i\\'m the guy from the work who has lost his minds spending hours finding the stocks. So then he said sure I will give you my two hrs to help you get educated about the principles of stock market w/o taking your millions of dollars. I was so happy and excited that now I will be able to beat the market and make a name for myself in \"Wall street\". As I was going through the house I realized that there was no one in the house which kinda felt strange at first but then later when we sat down it all felt comfortable.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n \\n\\n[A conversation with the man himself.](https://preview.redd.it/unzsiwhzube91.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42acf2639d354ea221d07e2eb1d2bf9cbb89215c)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo here’s the conversation that took place b/w me a reddit noob of \"Wallstreetbets\" and the man who beat the market in the later half of the 70\\'s decade when the market rebounded.\\n\\n( Me = Wall street Noob , Peter = The great “Peter Lynch” )\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Sir, do you know it\\'s pleasure to meet you in person. I’m a huge fan of you and so are the many of the investors in Wall street corporate america.\\n\\n**Peter :** Well thank you. Glad to hear but hey please don\\'t tell me about the future as it could mess with the timelines. Haha.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Sure. Do you know what sir? We have a community which is kinda like the community in the physical realm where we take down large corporations by making bets. Kinda like David vs goliath.\\n\\n**Peter :** Oh really that sounds cool. It looks like people in the future are really not afraid of investing.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Well sir right now everyone is. We all are realizing that it is a hard game. Not for everyone. The only thing we guys do is post our losses on reddit and brag about it.\\n\\n**Peter :** What so fun bragging about your losses. Don\\'t you guys wanna make money?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Well sir it\\'s complicated. You wouldn\\'t understand,\\n\\n**Peter :** Do you even know who i am?\\n\\n \\n\\n**Me :**  Sorry sir. I didn\\'t mean it that way.\\n\\n**Peter :** \\\\*\\\\* Uff what a loser. Okay. Shall we start?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** \\\\*\\\\*Silently  Yes.\\n\\n**Peter :** Lemme ask you a simple question. What kind of stock do you own? And the reason why?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Well sir i used to own these what i called Voldemort asset class kind of stocks because they went up so much. I think they will go up again in 2024-25 due to the halving cycle associated with them. This type of stocks would have place in the so called \"Metaverse\" which would be a place in digital world. What about you sir. What kind of stocks do you own?\\n\\n**Peter :** Well I own this company. They make a relatively mundane product. It’s a one megabit, S-ram, Cmos, Bipolar risk, Floating point data I/o array processor with optimizing compiler, 16-bit dual port memory with Unix operating system, 4 whetstone mega flop polysillicon emitter with high bandwidth. It’s really important. 6-Ghz double metallization communication protocol, asynchronous backward compatibility, peripheral bus architecture, four wave interleave memory token ring interchangeable back plane. And this all happens in 15 nanosecond of capability.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Wow sir. It must be really good stock. It might definitely go up.\\n\\n**Peter :** Well if you buy companies like this kind of story. It is owning sh9t tbh. It will never make money. So shall you.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Huh, why.\\n\\n**Peter :** Well what would you do if your stock goes from 69 to 9. Will you buy more or walk around the block and call your friends.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Sir it already is. All these stocks are down like 70%+. xD\\n\\n**Peter :** That is the problem. Look man. I buy stocks like Dunkin Donuts, Stop and Shop, CBS, Sallie Mae. Do you know this Sallie Mae is kinda interesting. Not many people look at it. Imagine loaning money to students and no one looked at it. These are the kind of stuff i buy.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Oh i see. You mean sir find the **hidden stock that no-one is looking at which has nice and simple business.** Easy to understand. Got it.\\n\\n**Peter :** You say right now you will but I know you won’t do this. Because you don’t wanna know the story of the stock.\\n\\n \\n\\n**Me :** Sir I will. Trust me. By the way sir i always wanna ask you a way to predict how high the Fed funds rate will go. I mean what technicals do you guys look at? Do I have to watch dot plots and forward guidance by the Fed and do some integral calculations to calculate recession.\\n\\n**Peter :** What\\'s wrong with you? No. **Stop trying to calculate when the recession is going to happen or when the stock market will go up/down or how high the interest rates would go.** Tbh, I would love to get next year\\'s wall street journal. But you just don\\'t.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Sir I can get it for you. I have this machine. Oh sh9t sorry sir. I only have fuel for one journey.\\n\\n**Peter :** God. Why do you wanna mess with timelines? Anyway, I remember in 1982 we had a 20% prime rate, 15% government bonds, double digit unemployment and double digit inflation. I don\\'t remember anyone telling me about that in 1980 they did though in 1981. But in 1983 I remember they said well the economy bounced back well but we will have a recession 85. In 85 they said recession 86. Something happened in 87 October. Everyone lost like 7 figures. Something bad happened. Then they said sure recession 88 and then they said 89 for sure recession and then in 90 we were supposed to have this so called soft landing which we never had. So in general I always tell this to others. **If you spend 13 minutes in economics you have wasted 10 minutes.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Don\\'t worry about me sir. I never even attended a business school. Haha.\\n\\n**Peter :** Look, all you wanna about the stock **market is it goes up and goes down. Sometimes it goes down a lot.** It’s good to know what\\'s gonna happen with the economy but **I deal with facts.** If inventories are going back, if copper prices are going down, if room occupancy is going the wrong way, people are building too many hotels. I look at freight cars holdings, railroad stocks. I deal with facts. **I don\\'t deal with people telling me something\\'s gonna happen in future.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Sir but i can predict and i have been right so far.\\n\\n**Peter :** Do you have a psychic line or something? You don\\'t really get it. Do you.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** I don\\'t know. \\n\\n**Peter :** Well look you have got plenty of time. Right? Why are you in a rush to buy a stock. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Sir because whenever i go on fancy dates. The girl asks me my net worth. So i just say i\\'m waiting for the right moment. \\n\\n**Peter :** Oh God. Look man. **You could have bought Walmart 10 yrs after it went public you would have made 30 times your money**. Just so because you waited. Why cant they be in 15 or 18 or lets say 26% of the entire Usa.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** But sir now its just at every state except one.\\n\\n**Peter :** That’s not the point. The point is you have plenty of time in this business.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** But sir i’m quite confused. I get scared sometimes from stocks. Hence I advised my people on Wall street bets to get bonds. At least they would make above 3%. But sir they called me chicken little.\\n\\n**Peter :** Look man there is nothing to be scared of stocks. Lemme give you 10 most basic dangerous things about stocks. By knowing them already you would not get scared later on.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**1. “It’s gone down already it cannot go much lower”**\\n\\nThere was a stock called Polaroid. It went from 140 to 107. People said if it goes under 100 just back up the truck. Eventually it broke 100 and went to 18 in nine months.\\n\\nI had an experience one time with Kaiser in Fidelity. We were gonna buy the biggest block ever in history 10-15M shares. Stock had gone from 29 to 17. I called my mom and asked how much lower it could go. Then it went to 10, 9 and to 7, 6 , 5 , 4. Fortunately this happened rapidly otherwise I would have been working at Stop and See. This all happened in 6 months. I was a little early at 15 and 3 quarters as my avg price. We call this premature in business. Had a correction which you know is a euphemism for losing a lot of money rapidly. Then again did an analysis. They own a lot of things steel, aluminium, cable etc. Funny thing is they had no debt. No one has ever gone bankrupt w/o debt. So i thought it wont go to 0. But they did. So they sold all businesses and gave back the shares. Eventually they were then sold to some company for $55/share. I also saw Taco bell go from 14 to 1 in 1974. They too had no debt and making 60c/share.\\n\\nSo never say the stock can’t go any lower.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** \\\\*In my mind. Hmm, I will buy Microsoft and Apple at $1 someday. Sir what are the other 9 i wanna know more.\\n\\n**Peter :** Well here’s the corollary to the above one. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**“It’s gone high already, how could it possibly go any higher”**\\n\\nSo Philips Morris was a stock that was adjusted for splits. Sold for 12c in 1951. Then it went to 60c in 1961. So everybody was wondering how high it could go. It has already gone 5x. These experts of the markets underestimated the power of Marlboro. They missed that there are 220 countries in the world. They missed cash flow. They missed everything. This stock was 100 bagger after going up 5x. But people sold it just because they thought how much higher it could go. They did the same with home depot, I did the same with ToysRuz. \\n\\nSo just don\\'t this okay. It’s a very bad thing and dangerous.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**2. Here\\'s another one that sucks. “Eventually they always come back”**\\n\\nRca just about to get back to its 1929 price was backed out by G. Manville never came back. International harvester even with its name changed and adjusted for splits doesn\\'t get all.way back. Western Union, Double Knits ( floppy disks ) These stocks don\\'t have to come back. But people say they will eventually come back. This is all not true.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Wooah sir. That is too much to process. Can you slow it down a bit.\\n\\n**Peter :** Can you just keep it up.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** \\\\*\\\\*Hmm Did i underestimate Tesla by selling at $1000+ and used the cash for buying Nio to recover to its original price.\\n\\n**Peter :** \\\\*\\\\* I know this guy doesn\\'t get anything. Well here\\'s another one for you. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**3. \"Suppose you buy a stock at $3 how much can you lose\"**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Obviously $3.\\n\\n**Peter :** Okay so tell me suppose your neighbour bought $10,000 worth of stock at price $50. And the stock is now at $3. You put $25000 at the price $3. If it goes to 0 who loses the most.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Sir, wait a sec. Can I use this calculator lying on the desk.\\n\\n**Peter :** God why do you need a calculator? Just think logically.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Ahh. I think my neighbour.\\n\\n**Peter :** God you\\'re stupid. Just figure out this on your way home. Here’s another one and better start writing these all points down.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**4. \"It’s always darkest before the dawn\" \"Business is awful terrible\"** \\n\\nHere’s this one you will be talking  before lunch. Freight car deliveries. In 1979 there was 96,000 freight cars in USA. Two yrs later. It fell to 45,000. The lowest in 23 yrs. From 96 to 45 thousand. People always say business is horrible pathetic. Then it falls to 25,000. They say just load up. There’s about 15 opportunities to lose money. There’s about 15 supplier of freight cars and 15 manufacturers. Then last year we shipped 7000 freight cars. Business now was continuing to get miserable.\\n\\nThere is a great opportunity to lose money in energy services industry. In 1982 there were 11,000 oil rigs drilling holes in Okhloma, Texas, Colorado. We used to recount them every week. Rig count fell from 11,000 in 1982 to 6,000 in 1983. And then some more in 1984. There’s hundreds of companies here. Mud, down hole, fracturing companies, Well companies. All measuring companies the chambers the bid companies. Lots and lots of opportunities to lose money here. Also equal opportunities for serious losses. People always say business is terrible. Lets buy these groups. The rig count was now 1000 three yrs ago.\\n\\n**So just saying business cant get any worse. It can always do more.** Once upon a time i had a textile industry in addition to metals. You then follow companies like JP Stevens, West roll pepper which were founded in 18th century. Burlington is new one which was founded in 1904. These people have been through recession, depression , world war. They have seen it all. There is a great expression in Texas industry. \\n\\n**It’s always darkest before pitch black.**\\n\\nSo remember if business is terrible it can always go terrible.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** \\\\*\\\\*Tech is doomed. Every thing is going to 0. Sir more more.\\n\\n**Peter :** Yah yah.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**5. “When it rebounds to 10 i will sell\"**\\n\\nWell you see this stocks went to 4 and people think it goes to 10 they will sell. So if they are really that confident shouldn\\'t you buy more. That\\'s like 66% return. But they think nope. They will sell. What you ought see never put down a round number. Stock will always go to 7 or 9. Never to 10.\\n\\nThe first first rule you need to know here is : **Stock does not know you own it**. Doesn\\'t matter how bad of a person you are with 69 spouses. If you own Coke for last 50 yrs the stock has gone 300x. You could be national hero, give donations, help cure cancer or aids but if you own Bethlehem steel. The stock is lower than it was 30 yrs ago.\\n\\nSo its not your fault. Don\\'t take this personally. But people treat stock like grandchildren or puppy. They think stock knows who you are.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**6. \"I own conservative stocks, i don\\'t have to worry\"**\\n\\nPublic service Indiana went down 90%. Gulf state Indiana, long on lighting. This is oxymoron we own quality Texas banks that went to 0. We had quality new England banks that went to 0. These are companies that have been around 120-150 yrs.\\n\\nLot of people don\\'t inherit a stock from somebody. They’ll say my mother said on deathbed. Don\\'t sell the long island lightning. These so called conservative stocks like Eastman Kodak fell 75%, Ibm fell 75%.\\n\\n**Don\\'t tell anybody you own conservative stock. Companies are very dynamic.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**7. \"Look at all the money I’ve lost because i didn\\'t buy it\"**\\n\\nPeople say this all the time. I didn\\'t own blockbuster, home depot. Even i myself made a list of some 200 stocks that went 100x that i didn\\'t own. But people always worry about missing Microsoft, western digital, united airlines. People always worry about these kind of things. \\n\\n**So remember. You cannot lose money in stocks if you don\\'t own it. The only way to lose money in stock market is you buy stock, it goes down and you press sell button. This is the only way.**\\n\\nI swear people spouse cut newspaper in morning and there they say i was gonna buy Microsoft when it was at 3. I lost 3000 in Microsoft last night while i was sleeping. I was gonna buy 17000 shares of semiconductor at 10. Its now at 17. I lost 49000 on national semiconductor.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**8. \"I will miss this one but i will catch the next one\"**\\n\\nThis usually does not work. There’s a lot of copycats of Toysrus there’s trial world. There was lionel. There’s copycats of home depot. **Buying a next of something doesn\\'t work.** It’s really bad. It’s like buying on dips. Better way is to buy from dips.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**9. \"Stock has gone up i must be right. Stock has gone down i must be wrong\"**\\n\\nI’m convinced people do this every time. They buy stock at 10 very little. It goes to now 13. They say they don\\'t know anything more than they knew when they were at 10. It’s at 13 now. \\n\\nThe best thing that could happen to them is if stock directly go from 10 to 4. But for these people it eventually will go 4 but it goes 13 in middle. They convinced now. They bought 100 shares at 10. They now buy 20,000 at 13. All the fact is stock went from 10 to 13 as it went up. \\n\\n**The average movement of stock in this century b/w its high and low has been 50%. Stock goes up and down a lot. Stock goes up means you\\'re right doesn\\'t mean a damn thing.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**10. \"Avoid long shots\"**\\n\\n**This is called whisper stocks.** These stocks will grow your hair, make your kid have better spelling and your breasts can improve and you won\\'t have to iron your pants. Its those stocks that will do everything for you. These stocks don\\'t have any sales yet. But my god if this works its gonna be the next xerox. It’s going to help murder in space and everything. It’s very good. \\n\\nNow this is not a long shot **its a no shot.**\\n\\nI have tried 30 of these and i have never broken even on a long shot. Never. I made 25 or 30 times money on stocks i never thought about like Sallie Mae or Mbia, Fannie Mae or some of the banks. Stop and shop made 20 times to 30 times of money. \\n\\n**So if you go into stocks thinking you will make 4-20 times of your money then probably that stock won\\'t work for you. Long shot don\\'t work.**\\n\\nAnd if you do wanna buy them at $3 and you know its gonna do a 100x. Meaning it will go $300. So write a story down at $3 and wait a few months after it goes $13 just check whether they started doing sales yet or not.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** \\\\*\\\\*Noting everything down. Woaah sir. Thank a lot for this tips. Sir can you please tell me the other things that you look at and what all skills do i need to pick right stock\\n\\n**Peter :** Look man. You will find many people in this industry telling you to look at management or be Math\\'s Olympiad winner etc. Trust me you don\\'t need any of that. Here\\'s why.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**- Management**\\n\\nManagement is a very important thing for a company. But for an outsider to differentiate b/w average, good or worst management is tough to do. You only get an hour to decide. How do you know what decisions they didn\\'t make. A lot of good decision company made is when they didn\\'t made an acquisition. Or they didn\\'t get rid of division.\\n\\n**So the best decision is to buy a company that any fool can run.** Like ex Toyzrus. Any fool even you can run the company. They had the right formula to begin with with no competition. What they were doing had no copycats. They were gonna steam roll for next 25 yrs. Same with circuit city. \\n\\nIn the end the story should be solid. If management can add anything on top of it. Great. Don\\'t buy a company if someone tells you it has great management. Great management is always attached to how much has stock gone up last yr. Look at Reynolds metals. The stock had same person for 30 yrs. When Aluminum was tight they say Reynolds had great management. Aluminium got oversupplied they said these people are idiots Aluminium gets tight again they say people are terrific. All it had to do was with the stock price. And they kept writing how it had great management with how stocks were doing. So again **it\\'s very hard to measure management.** If you get a chance to see them in action for 1-2m then sure. But you don\\'t get that kind of chance.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** \\\\*\\\\*I’m so gonna get rekt in Coinbase. The guys in All in podcast told me Brian Armstrong have excellent control of management. Sir do tell more.\\n\\n**Peter :** Well another thing is\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**- Be Flexible**\\n\\nPeople have these biases or prejudices that they won\\'t buy high growth companies, they will say no to financials, they won\\'t buy savings and loans, they won\\'t buy companies with letter R. So don\\'t cut yourself to just one segment.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnother important thing is \\n\\n**- Math :**\\n\\nI was very good at math\\'s till multiplying and then calculating speed distances all sorts of stuff. But then they introduced cosine one day. Then came tangent, cotangent and area under the curve with some integral calculus. This is all garbage seriously for the stock market. You don\\'t need this all kind of stuff for picking stocks. But for some reason Hedge funds and institutions guys do. **If you can just add 8+8 and get answer close to 16. That\\'s all you need in the stock market.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n400M in debt, no cash, no equity and company losing money = bad stock. Forget it.\\n\\n300M in cash, no debt, 200M in net worth, they are losing 10M on a quarter = they will be around.\\n\\nIf you passed 5th grade you will make it in this field. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** So sir you\\'re saying if i go and barge Fidelity, Bridge Water or Black rock doorsteps tomorrow. They will sign me up for the job just because i can do 3rd grade maths.\\n\\n**Peter :** Well they should.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Yes. If this Wsb post didn’t work out. I’m going there tomorrow.\\n\\n**Peter :** \\\\*\\\\*I hope he gets kicked out of the door at Fidelity. Well moving on here’s another most important thing to know about.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**- “There’s always something to worry about”**\\n\\nLook, the thing is everybody has got the brainpower to do well in the stock market. The Question is whether you **have the stomach for it.** That’s the key organ. There’s always something to worry about. I grew up as a kid in their 50\\'s. In the decade of the 50\\'s there’s a big theory that depression was caused by the stock market crash. Totally wrong.\\n\\nLess than 1% of American owned stock in 1929. We had this big time depression. It wasn\\'t caused by the stock market. It was that the economy went down and the Fed raised rates and we had a big time depression. In fact we had several depressions from 1850 on. But people thought the only reason we got depression was World war 2 and they said once we get back next time if a recession comes then that recession will turn into depression. And its gonna be “Great Depression” I never understood this adjective before Depression. Like there could be \"Crummy depression\" or \"Bad depression\" too. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Great Depression](https://preview.redd.it/i6e10fpqgce91.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae4040118dc33f90f4245ff9fc6a38e76d525fae)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**So people weren’t buying stocks in 50\\'s because they thought another “Great Depression” was going to happen.** In addition people were very scared about nuclear warheads and war in the 1950\\'s. People were building fallout shelters, stocking mccan goods. There’s something about going into Vermont and building a fallout shelter putting canned goods in it that you don\\'t buy at Minnesota mining. Your’e buying lots of water, shotguns, buying frozen food that will stay in freezer with your own generator. And you’re looking at growth stocks. It doesn\\'t seem to work out that way. I remember in my class in 1950\\'s. Someone would come over and blew whistle and you get under your desk. I thought at that time it wont do us any good. But people were worried about nuclear war and depression in 1950\\'s. The war heads couldn\\'t do that damage in 1950\\'s. But everyone was like they could blow up the entire world. We now stopped worrying all about this. \\n\\nThe 50\\'s in my opinion was best decade of the century except for the 80\\'s. Slightly better. People didn\\'t expect a lot. It was just okay. We made it through and stock market was terrific. You know there was a time oil went from 4 to 40 and expert said they would go to 100 and all countries in world would go bankrupt. And then big banks go bankrupt and we are gonna have “Great Depression” and stock market would go down and you wind up selling pencils and apples. The Oil went from 4 to 40 and expert said it will go 100 but then 2 yrs later it went to 14. The expert now much higher paid at this point are saying its gonna go to 4 and we are gonna have depression. Can you believe it?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Oil : $4 to $40.](https://preview.redd.it/0p2cpix7hce91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=06030e7d0e8e0f9c51b76209448021a25722edfd)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Nope. \\\\*\\\\*Hmm JP Morgan said similar thing with Oil $350. Are they all f\\'ing with us.\\n\\n**Peter :** I remember one time it was money supply going too fast. We are gonna have depression. They were going too slow then too we were gonna have depression. Then there was Ldc debt. All the banks were very smart and lend all their net worth to Zimbabwe, Botswana, Chile and bunch of all other countries that are hard to pronounce. These countries weren\\'t doing well and were less developed. Now we have to call them emerging countries. It’s politically very incorrect to call a country an undeveloped country. The other day i found out that the term for somebody overweight is laterally challenged. So there was this rumor that all these Ldc debts given to countries were going to go bankrupt. And we were gonna have depression.\\n\\nThen there was Mid-east fighting going on and they weren’t gonna buy our bonds and market crashing and we would have depression. And then there was Japan crisis. They weren’t gonna buy our bonds and we were gonna have depression. Within 3 yrs Nikkei index went from 40,000 to 16,000. The banking system was in trouble. People said Japan was gonna collapse. And we were gonna have depression. Then there were issues like Global warming and real estate etc. \\n\\n**So the thing is as older as you get the more nervous you become of all these things. Younger people are hence better investors coz they are not worried and they haven\\'t heard about all these crisis.** If you don\\'t have any kids you gotta rent kids for weekend. Seriously. And ask him about money supply. Ask him about the shape of yield curve is it bad or good. Or that we are into 48.3 months of economic recovery. The average recovery is less than 52.3 months. Ask an 8 yr old about all this. The reason being they have high exp of about the next 20 yrs. That’s what you need to do.\\n\\nThe more you get away from 8 yr old, the more you start reading about these crazy things from weekend. You are not gonna make it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe fact from 1955 to 1985 the stock market went up grand total of 1000 pts but it was down 800 on Mondays. So there it was 1800 up on non Mondays. It wasn\\'t accident that stock market went down in October 1987 on Monday. People on the weekend become economists in portfolio strategies. I remember this day on Monday. I took vacation a week before. My fund went from 13B to 9B in two working days. So there was this rumor circulating that i knew market was gonna go down on Monday.\\n\\n**In all i wanna say i can guarantee you that the market is gonna be lot higher in 15 yrs. It will be a lot higher in 25 yrs.** What’s it gonna do in the next 1 or 2 yrs i have no idea. Here’s a cool thing about interest rate. If you get them right 5 times in a row with ten grand you can have $2B. There is not lot many people with $2B and still lot of people take credit for predicting interest rate.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo in general i don\\'t care about all of this. **All i know In 96 yrs of century market has fallen 53 times with 10% or more decline.** That means once every 2 yrs we have 10% decline. Out of 53 declines 15 have been 25% or more. So 15 times in 96 yrs. **That is once every 6 yrs market falls 25% or more.** That’s what we call bear market. It’s all gonna happen but i don\\'t care when its gonna happen.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me ;** Wow sir that\\'s a lot. Anything you wanna add more.\\n\\n**Peter :** You want more. Okay  \\n\\nHere’s a quick summary of some more points that you need to keep in back of your mind :\\n\\n* Don\\'t forget about **investing internationally.** I made a bunch of my money there because of less coverage by the media and less people interested in following companies.\\n* **There’s always a company that is mispriced.** If you look at 10 you will find one. If you look 100 you will find 10. So go out there and find them.\\n* Most people ask me “When to sell a stock” Well i always tell them whatever the reason was for **buying the stock that must be your reason to sell** and when.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHere’s a really cool piece of advice you’’ll love it.\\n\\n**Me :** Yes sir. Do tell.\\n\\n**Peter :** Diversification is sh9t. I call it diefaecation.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** What? Everybody on Youtube tells me to diversify my portfolio.\\n\\n**Peter :** They are probably a bunch of fools. I call them amateur. **Just own one damn good stock**. No need to buy 2 and 3 and balance their beta alpha whatever. This all makes investing so easy.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** So sir you’re telling me to place all my chips in one basket.\\n\\n**Peter :** Look man while buying a stock you have to know a good story. **If you come across 10 good. I do that too. Find 10 good attractive companies.** It makes me feel like i’m watching a poker game. So story 3 gets better, but story 6 get flops, story 7 remains same but it goes up 50% so sell 7 and buy 2.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** But sir you just told me to pick one earlier. Now you\\'re telling me to pick 10. What is it?\\n\\n**Peter :** God you\\'re the worst guy ever I have come across. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Sorry. \\\\*Sad face\\n\\n**Peter :** Okay. Don’t start crying now. Here i will give the three total BS advise that you will ever come across.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** \\\\*Excited Yes sir. Do tell.\\n\\n**Peter :**  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Women can\\'t control money and deal with personal finance.\\n* We are in 4th innings of bull market\\n* And number 3rd which could be possible true. There will be a lot less US banks in future because UK has very less banks\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** None of that is useful to me\\n\\n**Peter :** \\\\*\\\\*Angrily gets out of chair. God get out of my house. You have done nothing but wasted my 2 hrs.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** What did i do\\n\\n**Peter :** You keep asking these stupid question in b/w and never get anything at all.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** \\\\*\\\\*Maybe its because i have been scrolling lots of sh9tposts recently\\n\\n**Peter :** Just go back to wherever you came from man.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** But sir i think we are heading to depression. I just don\\'t know if its Stagflationary or Deflationary\\n\\n**Peter :** Were you even making notes in the conversation.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Yes sir. I was.\\n\\n**Peter :** So just read your goddamn notes and get out. Never come back here again.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** \\\\*Walks to door. \\n\\n**Peter :** \\\\*Shuts the door on my face.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Me :** Hmm i forgot to ask him about this balance sheet\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Can you identify the balance sheet?](https://preview.redd.it/jz1zy7yhdce91.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a4b4229b324b3ffc5c40e685145e17ef1c3293a)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Peter :** This upcoming generation is gonna be poor.

I also do hope you get the underlying meaning associated with this conversation held and try relating it with current scenario. If you do then comments down below to share your experience. I love hearing your opinion guys.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Read this book.](https://preview.redd.it/nc2arp8xdce91.jpg?width=1247&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ab56469a4320d47b737c9b73936ee66201c0ca)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUntil then good night guys.\\n\\nPeace out.\\n\\nRegards\\n\\nUchiha'}, {'text': \"Good evening degens, let me introduce you to one of the most undervalued company I have seen in a long while: Globus Maritime.\\n\\n**Who they are and what they do**\\n\\nGlobus Maritime is a drybulk shipping company operating on a worldwide basis. What does that mean? They currently own and operate 9 drybulk carriers on a worldwide basis. These are not container ships, they store and transport raw commodities such as iron and other ores, coal, grains, sugars and cement.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[That's their biggest vessel. What a beauty, right?](https://preview.redd.it/7ta0tq8jfld91.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6daa736d75565c8620f5a2e0eebad64674e6f06c)\\n\\n \\n\\n**Where does the value sit**\\n\\nThere are a few different ways of approaching this to find value, but first, a preview of their financials. The company has a Price to Book Value of 0.2, specifically it has Assets for $196 million, total Liabilities for $37 million and Equity for $159 million. The company has lost money for a while, but in recent years they have expanded their fleet, fixed their balance sheet and have become profitable. 2021 was the turnaround year for them, with a Net Income of $15 million, and in **Q1 2022 alone they have generated a Net Income of $12 million with a Free Cash Flow of $8 million.**\\n\\n**Note:** “For dry bulk, seasonality is mainly focused on weather-related disruptions, seasonal construction demand, stocking cycles, heating degree days, and grain harvesting. Most industry participants know that the first calendar quarter of each year is the weakest period of the year”. **This means that they generated close to FY 2021 Net Income in Q1 alone, which is supposed to be their weakest industry-wide.**\\n\\nI am now taking you through my 3 approaches for valuing the company with 3 different horizons, but first I need to explain some things about the industry they work in.\\n\\n1. Their top line depends on the demand for raw commodities such as the ones cited beforehand. This means that the demand for their services depends to some degree on economic activity, but mainly from the demand of the raw commodities they ship, which due to the essentiality of most materials they transport makes them highly resilient, although intrinsically seasonal.\\n2. The fleet of bulk carriers that they own is valued at cost minus depreciation, which may reflect either a depressed or overstated value based on the market conditions, that’s why during my analysis I have also taken into consideration the safest way of valuing their fleet: scrapping value. When a ship cannot be sold, is too old to operate or the market conditions make it a more profitable choice, ships get sent to the recycling facility to get scrapped and the company receives cash/ton of scrapped vessels based on current scrap markets rates. This is the safest and surest way to value their ships, meaning that their value cannot be less than how much it would be worth to scrap them.\\n3. The scrapping rates are calculated as $XXX / ldt (light displacement tonnage), which is used to define the total weight of the ship alone, without any equipment, fuel or anything else (basically the weight of the scrappable material). The company does not make this data public, but I have been able to estimate their LDT using the data about their fleet that the company actually makes public + a study on the industry and how much of a vessel’s carrying capacity is then available to scrap (in technical terms, how to go from DWT to LDT).\\n4. The company’s vessels are estimated to have a useful life of 25 years each.\\n\\n*Valuation n.1 - A pure value approach to their current balance sheet*\\n\\nI will now deep dive you into their balance sheet and the valuation process, all the data shown next will reference their balance sheet on March 31st 2022.\\n\\nThe company’s fleet is carried on their books for $128 million, they are sitting on $59 million in cash and have some other minor assets worth $7 million.\\n\\nThe company has $30 million in debt and $7million in other minor liabilities.\\n\\nAs for the scrapping value of their fleet, the current market rates ($550/ldt) the company’s fleet would be worth $110 million. I have used a more conservative and kind of worst-case scenario of $400/ldt in my valuation, which gives us a scrapping value for their entire fleet of $80 million.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[These are the possible liquidation values for the company based on their balance sheet on March 31st 2022](https://preview.redd.it/amd37fmmfld91.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=c63de8bcf938b6f34fa92e2b89dcb0c76df286bb)\\n\\n \\n\\nAs you can see from the spreadsheet above, we have the DWT (Deadweight Tonnage, i.e. the weight of raw material each vessel can carry), the average conversion rate of DWT to LDT for dry bulk carriers, and some more data I will now walk you through.\\n\\nScenario A (**Net A**) values the company using only their cash, scrap value and liabilities. This is the absolute worst case scenario liquidation value for the company, this means that I believe the company to be worth no less, in any possible way, than that $104 million. I want to stress this: the company is currently selling at below their available cash. Just subtracting their liabilities from their cash would leave the company with $22 million in cash and no debt whatsoever. Adding to all of this, the scrapping value of their fleet, that is, the value they can 100% get from their ships by recycling them is $82 million, for **a total worst case scenario liquidation value of $104 million, more than 3 times what the company is currently trading at.**\\n\\nScenario B (**Net B**) uses the fleet book value instead of their scrapping value, all the rest stays the same. If one believes the company to be able to sell their fleet for 100% of their book value (cost of the ship - depreciation) then it would be worth $152 million on their balance sheet alone.\\n\\nScenario C (**Net C**) is the one I believe to be the most reflective of their actual value from the balance sheet alone. It assumes that the oldest 6 vessels the company owns will be scrapped and the newest 3 vessels (each built in 2015, 2018 and 2015 respectively) will be sold for 80% of their book value (or at a 20% discount, however you want to call it). This valuation method would give the company a liquidation value of $130 million, which is more than 4 times what the company is currently trading at.\\n\\n**Note:** Remember that these three valuation estimates are highly conservative since we kept the scrapping value at $400/ldt while they currently sit at $550.\\n\\n*Valuation n.2 - A pure value approach to their 2024 balance sheet*\\n\\nThis one requires some explanation as to how their balance sheet is going to change from here to 2024. On May 11th the company entered into two contracts for the delivery of 3 new vessels for a total cost of $108 million (which means that, in 2024, the company will be operating a total of 12 drybulk carriers). This will be financed either through equity or the creation of new debt. The first case might be possible due to the company’s history of issuing new equity to fund their activities but thanks to their current profitability and my future estimates (on which I’ll go more in depth later) I believe they could fund these new vessels through the cash they will generate and some new debt. Based on my estimates this is what the data will look like on December 31st 2024.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[These are the possible liquidation values for the company based on their balance sheet on December 31st 2024](https://preview.redd.it/7v7vzgmpfld91.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=127d19be878b998dbe215ee1c0505be19991534d)\\n\\n \\n\\nScenario A (**Net A**) uses the same calculations as before, but the scrapping value does not keep up with the increased debt used to acquire the new 3 vessels so is actually lower than today’s worst case scenario. Either way, in 2024 I estimate the company to be valued at $90 million in the absolute worst case scenario, based only on their cash, the scrap value of their fleet and their total liabilities. **Still three times what the company is currently trading at.**\\n\\nScenario B (**Net B**) uses the same calculations as before, so if one is to believe that the company can sell its entire fleet for the amount they carry on their books the company would be worth a total of $210 million in 2024 based on their balance sheet alone, **approximately 7 times what the company is currently trading at**.\\n\\nScenario C (**Net C**) is the one that I believe to be the most reflective of the company’s value in 2024 based on their balance sheet alone. There are some differences from the calculations used in the previous Scenario C, but the approach is similar. The oldest 6 vessels are assumed to get scrapped for a rate of $400/ldt (again, very very conservative), then the 3 more modern vessels mentioned before are assumed to get sold for 70% of their book value (or at a discount of 30%, as you prefer) and the newest ships built and delivered in 2024 are assumed to be sold off at a 10% discount. **This gives the company a valuation of approximately $180 million based on their balance sheet alone at 2024’s end.**\\n\\n*Valuation n.3 - A consideration of their balance sheet and their future streams of revenue*\\n\\nThis one is the more complete valuation of the company based on their future earnings potential but it’s also the least accurate since I am trying to, although conservatively, predict their future earnings, debt, costs, ecc.\\n\\nI’ve spent quite some time on this spreadsheet and I’ve kept a very conservative stance in predicting their future, for example, I’ve assumed a 30% decline in revenue in 2023 since 2021 and 2022 have been helped by a higher market rates for drybulk shipping and I’ve also accounted for a slowdown in economic activity. I’ve also assumed an interest rate hike of 4% for the entirety of 2022 (consequently weighing on their debt) and an inflation rate of 10% for the entirety of 2022 (weighing on their costs). I’ve also reduced the revenue for the 2nd half of 2022 since the first six months have been characterized by higher shipping rates which are currently falling to more normal levels. I feel that going through this spreadsheet would take too long, so I am going to leave it here for you all to see and analyze and I will respond to any comments and questions about it. **My personal valuation of the company, considering both the balance sheet and their possible future earnings potential is $260 million through 2027.**\\n\\n**Link to the pdf of the spreadsheet:** [**https://docdro.id/mtrA1Dg**](https://docdro.id/mtrA1Dg)\\n\\nMy (SPOILER: LONG) comment from the spreadsheet about the financing of their new 3 vessels getting delivered in 2024:\\n\\n*Based on these projections FY 2022 should result in a Net Income of around $45 million.*\\n\\n*Three new bulk carriers are getting delivered in 2024 and they cost a total of $107.8 million, of which $21.2 million have already been paid in cash in May 2022.*\\n\\n*The company will need an additional $86.6 million dollars for the period 2022-2024 to fulfill their commitment, and could probably cover it fully with the cash they are going to generate, but are more realistically going to rely either on debt, new equity or both.*\\n\\n*It's hard to model the diluting effects of a possible equity offering (not knowing the future levels of the stock), so we are going to assume they will use a mix of cash and debt here (which is also a realistic possibility given their newfound profitability). Additionally, the effects of a possible offering would be borne by the shareholders and wouldn't affect their P&L as new debt would.* ***Given that they are currently trading at one fifth of their book value I think that, even in the case of a new equity offer, the shareholders would end up better off notwithstanding the dilution.***\\n\\n*The CIT Loan Facility was negotiated when they carried 6 vessels on their books for a total of $58.9 million.*\\n\\n*They were able to negotiate a facility of $34.25 million at LIBOR + 3.75% with those assets as collateral, for a LTV of roughly 60%, which is the level at which, if the collateral falls below that, the company is prohibited from issuing dividends or doing buybacks.*\\n\\n*Hence, with the current value of their fleet sitting at $130 million I reasonably believe they could negotiate a facility of $65 million (let's stay conservative with a LTV of 50%, although if we assume the same conditions it could reach $78 million) at LIBOR + 3.75%*\\n\\n*Such a facility would allow them to repay the remaining $31 million from the previous facility while having around $35 million for their new 3 carriers coming in 2024.*\\n\\n*This would leave a net amount to fund of roughly $50 million, which I believe they could abundantly achieve through their current cash and that they will generate during 2022, 2023 and 2024.*\\n\\n*In the model we assume that the company will pay what's due in 2023 by issuing debt and then during 2024 use its cash to pay the final installment. That said, it is more likely the company will negotiate a facility and use only part of it in 2023 and use some of its cash on hand and then use the remaining fraction of the facility + the remaining cash in 2024.*\\n\\n*2023 revenue 0.7 multiplicator when compared with 2022 revenue is both due to the possible slowdown in economic activity due to high inflation and/or a possible recession and in part due to the fact that 2023 has in plan a number of dry-docking for their fleet, which will diminish their revenue-generating days of operations.*\\n\\n*Important note: the depreciation of dry-docking expenses for the new carriers received in 2024 won't start being recognized until at least mid 2027 cause they will be newly built, and even then in 2027 they won't be as heavy since the ships are new.*\\n\\n**Why is the company’s price so depressed**\\n\\nThe company’s stock has been hammered down because of their past negative EPS and most importantly because of the heavy dilution that the shares have seen in the past; the company has never been shy in issuing new equity to fund themselves and heavy dilution can be first traced back to the 2010s (the company has been founded in 2006). Another reason for their lower valuation (although not thoroughly sensical) is the fact that this is kind of a family controlled company. Their chairman used to own 60% of it, he now owns shy of 1% of the company but before selling his stake during the years the company (under his control) has issued preferred shares to his son (an executive director to the company) which grant him almost full control of it (10300 preferred B shares have been issued, each having 25k votes each, which would grant him full control if not for the fact that he and his affiliated parties, even having the majority of the voting power, as per the company statute denies them voting for more than 49.99% of the controlling power).\\n\\nThat said, I believe it to cause some misalignment of management’s interest with that of shareholders (since they have now little direct equity in the business) but their affiliates own around 38% of the company (so they have to be satisfied), plus they are managing it well and have in my opinion recently made a series of good and financially stable choices for their long term well being.\\n\\n**Possible risks and things to keep in consideration**\\n\\n1. One thing I do not explain to myself is why they are so illiquid. As I’ve said, the major shareholders in the company own around 38% of it, so the remaining 62% is in the hands of the market and no single other large major institution or shareholder, so I don’t know where all the volume is for the stock.\\n2. The company might dilute shareholders as they have done in the past to finance their business, but I don’t believe this to be a problem for three reasons, first they are now profitable and FCF positive, second they can negotiate new credit facilities thanks to the value of their collateral (Ships) having increased thanks to new acquisitions (and will keep increasing through 2024 once the new 3 vessels are delivered), and last with the company currently selling at one fifth of their book value dilution would have a limited effect on the shareholders and the value they hold. **That said, if they decide to dilute the shit out of you, then you're fucked.**\\n3. A global recession, especially in China which is one of the main areas of operations for global shipping companies could affect their top line due to lower market rates for drybulk shipping. That said, I’ve estimated that they will be profitable even at the lower bound of market rates, although slightly, which gives me confidence in their ability to withstand a global recession.\\n4. Their debt is floating so they are susceptible to rate hikes, but they have negotiated a new facility which halved the rate they were paying a few years back, and even if rates were to double (which I have assumed in my conservative calculations) they would go back to paying what they were a few years ago, and I’ve calculated that they can fully sustain that additional interest.\\n\\n**How you can play this**\\n\\nHonestly I’m not here to tell you what to do, each has to make choices based on their research and risk appetite, these are solely my opinions shared on an online forum. That said, I believe there are a few ways to play this depending on one’s vision (short or long term) and one’s appetite for risk (stock vs options).\\n\\n*Short Term (****the game I am playing****)*\\n\\nI believe that the short term value play is to go long at these depressed levels and wait for their next Q2 earnings release (and if you have a slightly longer time horizon even for their Q3 release, which due to seasonality in the business is usually the strongest). Q1 2022 has been their best quarter ever and has generated almost the same amount of resources as FY 2021. If Q2 and Q3 (as I believe) will be as good or even beat Q1 then the stock will see a massive rise (in part given the outstanding proven result and on the other hand given their absurdly low price relative to their cash, debt and book value or scrapping value, as one wants to see it). In my opinion we are looking at a 3x in the worst case scenario given all of what I’ve explained in this DD. Best case scenario for me is an 8x.\\n\\nMost realistic scenario for me is a 5x in their market capitalization, accurately reflecting their value.\\n\\n*Long Term*\\n\\nLong term here means holding at least through 2025 which will be the year that from an operational point of view will see them operating 12 ships, 3 of which modern and 3 of which brand new and more efficient than all the others. This means that they will be operating at almost 2 times the capacity of 2021, generating consistently positive FCF and making it possible for them to distribute dividends for the first time since 2012. As they keep paying back their debt and look for profitable opportunities to expand their fleet, they will keep growing in the longer term and will invest back in the business.\\n\\n**Final note:** Remember that every single estimate is extremely conservative, I’ve modeled the worst case scenario in each and every valuation attempt presented in this DD. I am personally invested in the company and have a long stock position in it because I believe that, given everything I’ve laid out before, this is the most undervalued company I have seen in a great while, and with all my estimates being skewed towards the low bounds of anything positive that could happen and higher bounds of everything bad that could happen, I am even more convinced of my thesis.\\n\\nI hope this has been an interesting read for you and I’m looking forward to comments, criticisms or questions if you have any.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** The company is extremely undervalued by any possible metric, are profitable and FCF positive, are growing their productive assets and have just had their best quarter while Q1 is usually the most difficult for the industry they operate in. That said, the company has a history for diluting the shit out of shareholders, they shouldn't require it now that they are profitable, but if they wanted to, then you are fucked.\"}, {'text': ' \\n\\nWelcome to Rad\\'s breakdown of the uranium sector. In this discussion I will be exploring the uranium sector as a whole, where things currently stand, what uranium is , what it\\'s used for, why uranium has a good setup for the future and how you can get into uranium should you choose to. I\\'ve been looking into this sector for over a year now and have done more hours of research than I could count. Before I get into anything I want to emphasize THIS IS A LONG TERM PLAY. This is not about buying weekly calls, this is not a squeeze. This is an investment in a growing sector that should provide significant returns in the next few years. I\\'m not bothering with short dated calls because right now the market is more or less whatever SPY does. SPY green, market green. SPY red, market red. If you want to do calls just play SPY for now since everything follows it. But if you want a good sector to put some cash that will pay off, then welcome to the discussion.\\n\\n**Uranium, what is it and why should I care?**\\n\\nMany of you have probably heard of uranium. It\\'s that green glowing rock that kills you if you go near it and makes a Godzilla right? Nope. First, it\\'s brown not green. Second, it\\'s actually not very radioactive out of the ground. It needs a bunch of stuff done to it before it becomes that glowing stick thing you see on The Simpsons. But what\\'s actually important about uranium is its use as a fuel source. Uranium is used to power nuclear powerplants. Plain and simple, that\\'s its use. And before you go \"Pfft nuclear is dead, waste of time.\" understand nuclear is actually more important than you think. As of today, the USA gets 20% of its baseload (24/7 consistent power generation.) power from nuclear. Yes 20%. That\\'s not a small amount at all. And globally nuclear accounts for 10% of global baseload power. So the idea that nuclear is dead isn\\'t correct. It\\'s too important right now to be dead. Unless you think the world is going to just go into full brownout and blackouts, nuclear globally isn\\'t being shut down in the next decade. It\\'s just too complicated for the USA to replace 20% of its entire baseload energy generation no matter how much wind and solar is built (I actually like wind and solar mind you.).\\n\\nOn top of being a major energy source nuclear is carbon neutral. A nuclear powerplant with a 40 year operational life will generate as much carbon over its lifetime as a coal powerplant will produce in just 2 hours of operation. That\\'s it. Not only is it carbon neutral, it\\'s highly energy efficient. One uranium fuel pellet will generate as much energy as one ton of coal, 149 gallons of oil or 1700 cubic feet of natural gas. What this means, you can store a ton of energy in a small space using nuclear. For the USA that might not matter, but for nations like Japan that don\\'t have as much space, being able to store years of energy in just a few warehouses is significant.\\n\\nPast the efficiency, nuclear is a baseload energy source unlike wind and solar. This means it generates consistent amounts of reliable electricity 24/7. Wind and solar can\\'t do this. Sometimes it\\'s not as windy. Sometimes it\\'s not as sunny. This matters because if you\\'re building an electrical grid, you need a certain amount of it to be providing a consistent predictable amount of energy. Otherwise, you risk blackouts at certain periods. Electrical grids NEED baseload energy in order to ensure the lights stay on. Right now the carbon free options are nuclear or hydroelectric. But while you can build a nuclear powerplant anywhere, hydroelectric is limited to areas with flowing water. Sure it works in the USA, but good luck providing electricity in the African desert with hydroelectric. I\\'m not saying wind, solar or hydroelectric are bad. I\\'m saying they can\\'t be your only energy generation either due to geographic limitations or having too much fluctuation in energy production. They\\'re great as PART of an energy grid, just not as 100% of it.\\n\\n**Downsides of nuclear.**\\n\\nWhile nuclear has many upsides there are of course downsides. Let\\'s start with the giant radioactive elephant in the room. NUCLEAR MELTDOWNS!!! OMG so scary right? They happen and then millions of people die and stuff. Except that\\'s not exactly true. People are familiar with 3 major meltdowns, Chernobyl, Fukushima and 3 mile island. Let\\'s do the easy one first. 3 mile island had a grand total of 0 deaths. I\\'ll say that again. 0 people died from 3 mile island. Nobody. That doesn\\'t mean it didn\\'t have some negative things, but there were no deaths. Not just that but they got the leak under control quickly. Now onto Chernobyl. Yes people died, and the nearby land was ruined. However, this was a very special case. See, the USSR really didn\\'t give a damn about the people of Ukraine when they build Chernobyl. Like at all. They wanted energy generation and skipped pretty much ALL safety regulations. Yes it was bad, but nobody will ever be allowed to build a powerplant that unsafe and unregulated ever again because of it. This was less nuclear bad and more neglecting any form of safety measures for any powerplant bad. Finally we have Fukushima. Yes a big scary disaster. But like 3 mile island nobody died from the meltdown. Now people died from the tsunami. But there were no recorded deaths from radiation exposure. Add in it took a historically large earthquake AND the powerplant regulators ignoring a key safety measure, moving the generators off the bottom floor, which they had been told to do for years. I don\\'t want to downplay these events but they\\'re not the world ending disasters the news likes to pretend they were. In fact, nuclear has the lowest death per KWh of any energy source wind and solar included. Add in new nuclear powerplants being much safer and having many fail safes. (Fun fact, Fukushima was actually OLDER than Chernobyl). Take the Zaporizhzhia nuclear powerplant in Ukraine. Russia recently bombed this powerplant during an assault. Everyone was freaking out. Know what happened? Nothing. Why? Because nuclear powerplant reactors are build with a protective core designed to take a DIRECT impact from a full 747. They\\'re a lot safer than people realize.\\n\\nNext downside, the cost. Nuclear powerplants are EXPENSIVE to build and a lot of companies don\\'t want to build them. It takes 10 years of operating for a powerplant to just break even. That\\'s a scary investment and a lot of companies won\\'t do it. But there are new powerplants being built. The US recently has 2 new powerplants finish in Georgia and is working on extending the lifetime of current powerplants including Diablo Canyon, the last powerplant in California which the governor has requested a 20 year life extension for and it looks like he\\'s going to get it. That\\'s right, even super green California is now changing their tune about nuclear. But it\\'s not just the USA. Germany has started talking about delaying the shutdown of their remaining powerplants (They probably won\\'t, but the fact Germany is even willing to discuss the idea shows a huge sentiment shift.) Japan\\'s new ruling party has made restarting their nuclear fleet (shut down since Fukushima) a top priority with plans for several reactors to come back online this year. India, South Korea, Romania, France all have plans for new reactors. Even Bill Gates is working in Wyoming on creating new safer small modular reactors (SMRs). Then there\\'s China. China has committed to building 150 new reactors over the next decade. Yes 150 reactors or 15 reactors a year. Simply put, nuclear isn\\'t going away and even seems to be growing now. Even Gretta Thunberg has come out in favor of nuclear.\\n\\n**Ok so nuclear will exist, who cares.**\\n\\nSo we\\'ve established two things, nuclear currently exists at a level too large to shut down anytime soon AND places aren\\'t just not shutting it down, they\\'re adding even more. Now we get to the money part. See that uranium used to power a nuclear powerplant, it has a problem. It\\'s too cheap. How cheap? Today uranium sells for $49/pound. But it costs a mining company $65-$70/ pound to mine it. Yes, companies currently lose $16-$20/pound mining uranium. But why would they mine it if they\\'re losing money is probably your question. Well, for most companies, they\\'re not. They have shut down all mining and are waiting for prices to go higher. This has created a major deficit in supply. Currently, 180 million pounds of uranium are used per year globally while only 120 million pounds are mined. That\\'s a 33% yearly supply deficit that has been going on for 3 years now. Now you might ask how is that possible. Well in 2011, when Fukushima happened, Japan shut down all their nuclear reactors. But, they had a bunch of nuclear fuel already in warehouses. Powerplants will have between 2-3 years of supply on hand at any given time. So what did these Japanese powerplants do? They sold all that uranium and flooded the market. Look below at the graph of the price of uranium starting in 2011.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yjy82kf6m1891.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c78a3ef97d1f49e6a575907faea73923e5b0646\\n\\nSee that giant price drop from $50 down to a low of under $20? That\\'s all that Japanese supply flooding the market. Well that supply is running out. Not only is it starting to run out, Japan is restarting their reactors as stated above, meaning they\\'re going from a net seller to a buyer of uranium. All that cheap supply utilities could buy up is disappearing, and when supply goes away prices go up. Let\\'s see another graph. from 2007. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/89ny4xtlm1891.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1514f8cfc1aa37153ec2cd574cf08ea6c43185e\\n\\nSee that giant price spike? That\\'s from supply going away. Specifically, from the USA ending their program of decommissioning nuclear weapons which gave a cheap supply of uranium for powerplants to buy. That same thing is about to happen in the uranium sector. All the cheap Japanese uranium has been bought and they\\'re done selling. This is going to cause another price spike and the mining companies are going to thrive. See, as stated earlier, most of these companies are not mining. What this means is they\\'re sitting waiting for the price to get to a level worth mining and then they\\'ll start selling. Now, in the uranium sector selling is done through a contract with utilities. Usually these contracts are signed for 10 years with a price range. A bottom price so the mines don\\'t get screwed and a top price so utilities don\\'t get screwed. As of today, most companies don\\'t have any contracts, but as the supply runs out utilities are going to be forced to talk to the miners and sign these long term contracts. And this isn\\'t just theoretical. Cameco (CCJ) the 2nd largest uranium mining company in the world announced in January they had signed 40 million USD in new contracting that month which was more than they did for the entire year of 2021. Other mines are also announcing the beginning of some early contracts as utilities are finally showing signs of realizing their nice cheap supply of Japanese uranium is going to run out. And when these contracts come it won\\'t be one or two at a time. It\\'s going to be a rush of utilities scrambling to get  contract signed with whoever they can. Because the uranium sector has one other key thing. It\\'s small. Tiny. How small? The entire uranium sector has a market cap less than that of Tesla. That\\'s it. Not only is the sector tiny, you can count on two hands ALL the companies currently able to mine uranium. And as for the ones trying to build a mine? The fastest ones expect to be running in 2024 AT BEST. Here\\'s another chart for you.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mplfck24o1891.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3cb58c6e2b1ceed55eb1cfcd7175d2534633685\\n\\nThis chart shows the total projected uranium mining compared to the demand out to 2040. See that red space above? That\\'s a deficit where demand beats out supply. Here\\'s the thing about this chart. It assumes a full restart of ALL existing mines AND ALL planned uranium mines. Yes. Even if every single mine and planned mine came online on time with full production there would still be a huge deficit. And uranium mines do not have near a 100% start rate. More like a 10% chance for a company to go from discovering uranium to actually getting a functioning mine. And understand something about uranium, it is an inelastic fuel. You can\\'t substitute anything for uranium. Either you have it OR you can\\'t run your power plant. And not running isn\\'t an option. Utilities can and will pay huge amounts to get their fuel supply. This is because uranium is a fraction of the cost of a powerplant. It accounts for just 5% of their operational costs. That\\'s it, so a powerplant can have the price of uranium shoot up and see minimal impact. The analogy I like to use, think of a steak dinner. The steak is what\\'s expensive. Now do you put salt on the steak? Sure. But do you care what the salt costs? If tomorrow salt did a 10X on price would you stop eating steak? No, because salt is dirt cheap so who cares what it costs. The same holds for uranium. And even if the price goes through the roof, governments will subsidize before they allow blackouts. Because that\\'s what the entire uranium sector really boils down to. Uranium sells for too little to the point where one of two things must happen. Either the price of uranium will go up to at least $65-$70/pound OR when you flick a light switch in the USA in 5 years, the lights will not work. That\\'s the bet you\\'re making, which one do you think is more likely to happen.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Sprott and uranium.**\\n\\nI\\'m going to take a quick second to talk about one other factor in the uranium sector. Sprott. For those of you unfamiliar, Sprott is a resource investment fund run by a man named Eric Sprott. He runs large physical funds that let investors buy shares which he then uses to buy physical gold or silver. Very simple system. You buy some shares, he buys some gold. You can sell your shares or ask for payment of gold in an amount equal to your shares. Well, he\\'s doing this exact same thing for uranium (minus the delivery part, sorry guys you can\\'t get uranium sent to your home.) The system is the same, you buy shares his company uses that money to buy physical uranium which they store in a warehouse. But here\\'s the thing, this is not a resell system. Sprott gets paid per transaction, they buy an amount and keep 1% of the purchasing fee for themselves. That\\'s how they make money. They DO NOT resell this uranium, in fact, there currently is no system to resell the uranium in place. What this means, there is a system in place currently taking in millions of pounds of uranium off the market that will not resell. This takes a deficit and adds even MORE pressure since now Sprott is buying up supply from utilities.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**So what do I do?**\\n\\nAh the big question, what do you do with this information. Well, you find uranium miners you like and buy shares or LEAPs (at least 1 year out though ideally 2). Why? Because this is a very simple play, the price of uranium will go up. That\\'s not the question. The question is WHEN will the price go up. So you play the miners and wait because at some point we will see utilities rushing to secure supply and when that happens these miners are going to rocket with it. Now a couple of things to understand. Because this sector is so small it can rocket but those rockets go both ways. When money is flowing in stocks can jump quick. But, when money flows out when, oh I don\\'t know, the entire stock market is selling off, money flows out quickly too. And that\\'s exactly what happened to uranium over the last 7 weeks. It\\'s been selling off hard. Add in the summer being a historically bad time for uranium and more selling won\\'t be a shock at all. So you\\'re probably saying why should you buy something that\\'s selling off and could sell off more? Well here\\'s why, because that\\'s when it\\'s cheap. Money is made in bear markets and realized in bull markets. You buy companies with a good long term outlook when they\\'re down because that gives you the best chance to make money.  And right now uranium miners are down at a very cheap level. Now this doesn\\'t mean throw every penny you have into it. Add over time, maybe do some cash secured puts, down cost average on dips. You\\'ve got all summer since uranium usually does poor until September or so. But now is a great time to position yourself in a sector looking good in the long run. Especially in a market where everything is being beat up. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Quick notes.**\\n\\nJust a quick addressing of some things I tend to hear asked. Throium reactors are a thing being worked on, but they aren\\'t ready yet and won\\'t be for years. Even when done they can\\'t do a 100% uranium replacement overnight it\\'ll take years. I like them but it\\'s future tech. Fission is also being worked on but that\\'s even further out future tech. It\\'s been \"20 years away\" for 50 years now. Yes, storage of spent nuclear material is an issue but they have some storage methods, even if not ideal and more importantly when given the choice of where do I store this fuel after 500 years or blackouts, governments will choose to deal with the storage later and avoid the blackouts. Yes wind and solar exist. I like them. I think they\\'re great. But as of today, they are energy that needs to exist with nuclear not replace it. The tech again just isn\\'t there yet. Yes new companies can build a uranium mine and uranium isn\\'t that rare. However, building a mine is a long and difficult process, especially to get permits. Most nations are very strict about allowing a company to mine uranium because of what it is. As such, you need to show not just you know how to mine it, you can do it safely and without impacting the environment. That can take near 10 years and often takes that long if not longer. So year, when prices spike new companies will pop up, but they\\'ll be a decade or more out from actually mining anything and this assumes they can even find staff who know how to run a uranium mine, which is not easy to find and get permits.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the gist of the uranium sector and why I feel it\\'s a good place to park some money for the next few years. It\\'s got a good future to it, it\\'s not going anywhere and in fact, shows strong signs of growing and it\\'s needed.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: Uranium is a needed irreplaceable fuel source that currently sells for too little. Either the price is going to go up over the next few years or the lights will go out. If you think the lights will work when you walk into a room you think uranium will go up. That simple. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Positions:** Note, for any company listed as \"under market cap\" just message me and I\\'ll tell you what it is.

Might as well skip it. ( Especially Tl;Dr folks )**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Story about an island doom.](https://preview.redd.it/qnp5sqa9y5191.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc686a2265dc0a73fbc4fc7dcbb3bd6ee0eb24bc)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBefore we begin creating our portfolio, let me tell you all a story. It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks  partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. \\n\\nAs the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren\\'t a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren\\'t moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn\\'t care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one\\'s, two\\'s and three\\'s, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one. They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. \\n\\nDays past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn\\'t quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts.\\n\\nAs the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island\\'s scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs.\\n\\nMoral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Streak of losses](https://preview.redd.it/0p0fdaqs76191.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb2ae85f441ef944661f785dc823c2804de42031)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Recap : 16th May - 20th May**\\n\\nThe last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 \"Great depression\". We also had 7 straight weeks of red which is just behind the March 2001 \"Dotcom crash\" and May 1970 \"Stagflation\".  \\n\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Apple warning : Later i said if Apple looks bad so will Tesla. Because both are cash Hedge.](https://preview.redd.it/5uy04hct86191.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=cae120eea4159b846bc1b5a7a871f8372b391bb2)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs my viewers already know we talked about Apple and Tesla warning in my last post where i was worried about their charts. So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y\\'all think. Tell me about in the comments section.  \\n\\n\\nBy the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ?  \\nEveryone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 \"Black Monday\" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day.\\n\\nAlso some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, )  \\n\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Hedge funds top Investments](https://preview.redd.it/ci20463xb6191.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=b08bfa1fb4ec35b7187b37d21d6527e82474e773)\\n\\nI was very lucky last week to have time and watch \"Jeremy Grantham\" and \"Ray Dalio\" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) \\n* Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash.\\n\\n  \\nBut both of them don\\'t believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years.  \\nAlso do watch \"All in podcast\" show. In latest episode we have a guy who predicted 5 out of the last 3 recessions and invested in We work.😂\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOkay moving on lets summarize key highlights of this week from CNBC television :\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Jet blue hostile bid for spirit airlines.\\n* Boeing is shit.\\n* Elon twitter drama.\\n* Oil to $150 after china deal.\\n* Warren Buffet buying energy and increasing stake in occidental petroleum.\\n* Healthcare and energy can be defensive and aggressive play for portfolio managers this year.\\n* Netflix upgraded by a bear.\\n* Walmart & Target earnings disaster.\\n* Retail sales 0.9% est 1% in April.\\n* Job cuts in Netflix and HOOD. Hiring freeze in Facebook & COIN.\\n* Fin-tech bottom is in according to analysts.\\n* Google is good in economic slowdown.\\n* Growth scare. Long term bond buying and equities falling regardless.\\n* The White House is now looking to cut corporate greed. Looks like no more price gouging.\\n* The unhedged hedge fund Melvin capital is shutting down. You guys did it. David won against Goliath.\\n* Identify the difference b/w short covering and bear market rally.\\n* Biden meets leaders of Sweden, Finland. Meaning they are going to join NATO this year.\\n* We have Monkey pox to deal with. Twitter says it\\'s the courtesy of Bill Gates.\\n* Auto loan delinquencies hits highest since 2007.\\n* Sam Bank-man Fried bought Robinhood. FTX is about to start stock trading. Meaning if CBDC\\'s by government arrives then petro dollar becomes hetero dollar of trading worldwide. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n  \\n**Where we stand**\\n\\nNow since many of you guys are new here. Let me bore you once again.\\n\\n  \\nWe will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don\\'t think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. \\n\\n  \\nHence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI.\\n\\nOr if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction.\\n\\n  \\nAlso we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives.  \\nYou could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index.\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Charts of the week** \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate](https://preview.redd.it/3u1mbte1p6191.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=be8ad4eb170a698565741d60a7d49df1296addc5)\\n\\nObservation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it\\'s the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate](https://preview.redd.it/h0cjy551q6191.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=72cce6906e84c0c7ea9788d6f384581e7a58575e)\\n\\nObservation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high\\'s and higher low\\'s. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high\\'s and lower low\\'s.\\n\\nDuring the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[The Boom Bust cycles XD](https://preview.redd.it/6flgxtk1v6191.png?width=1701&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb484b83893544c369e7464ebec953625014be9c)\\n\\nObservation 3 : ( Don\\'t laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation ](https://preview.redd.it/9xvnvb4t07191.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f82a75ceefbb99dff97840164118168305ebaf5)\\n\\nObservation 4 : Let\\'s find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940\\'s or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nResult : I have no idea where are we. This experiment was for nothing or maybe it was. But we pose similarity to all of the periods.\\n\\nDisease | Russia wise : 1921 Forgotten depression\\n\\nChart wise and cycle wise : 1929 depression.\\n\\nRate, Inflation and bond wise : 1940\\'s.  \\n\\nNews event wise : 1970\\'s stagflation. \\n\\nTechnology and funding wise : 2000 dotcom bubble.\\n\\nWSB wise : 2008 recession.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Welcome to the Jungle : Its time for our portfolio building**  \\n\\n\\nLook guys before we begin let me tell you i am not an expert of fundamental analyzing the companies. But what i am good at is knowing the narratives beforehand and combining it with my technical analysis on stock market where it is headed. But yah of course i do watch earnings and this week is gonna be awesome. Let us begin this unique way of investing.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[This week : Earnings + FOMC minutes. ](https://preview.redd.it/c7uth30ii7191.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=6183a56bf0a5b4e7ed50602033f5f933157d602e)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Hypothesis :** If stock valuation relative to others becomes cheap then the algorithms created by big institutions and Hedge funds will buy the stock and sell it quickly or hold according to their analysts or portfolio manger if they are interesting on betting the stock for next cycle.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>  \\n>  \\n>We are going to construct the most knowable portfolio passed down by the generations before. It\\'s called a 60-40% portfolio. But we are gonna make few adjustments to it.  \\n>  \\n>Equities : 60% -> 40% USA + 20% international  \\n>  \\n>Bonds : 40% -> 30% bonds + 10% metals.  \\n>  \\n>We don\\'t take commodities because they are for trading purposes mostly.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Step 1 : 10% metals**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Gold](https://preview.redd.it/co2df3tym7191.png?width=1557&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cfb1b7b3139cf4dc58820fbe3fb010bd5a841a9)\\n\\n[Silver](https://preview.redd.it/10lde2tym7191.png?width=1555&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9ea411e43a1969a012119d14cf5603c2fdcea3a)\\n\\nSince we are in 1921, 1929, 1940, 1970, 2000 or 2008. what we know is gold parabolic move is sure to happen. But what we don\\'t know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It\\'s only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025.\\n\\nMeaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nResult : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis )\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n  \\n**Step 2 : 30% bonds.**\\n\\nNow this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds](https://preview.redd.it/1c7wq9l7s7191.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=10cf499d408d901e549adac71debf8b4a3af9eaa)\\n\\nSo I picked TMF for this because i\\'m chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn\\'t yet been priced in.\\n\\nHence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%)  \\n\\n\\nTMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly )\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nResult : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT )\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n**Step 3 : 60% Equities.**\\n\\nNext 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\na) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks )\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIncludes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, \\n\\nWinner : MTTR, COIN\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nReason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c\\'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don\\'t like mining stocks.\\n\\nMatterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He\\'s got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nb) EV play.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIncludes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid\\n\\nWinner : Tesla, Nio\\n\\n  \\nReason : I\\'m going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won\\'t you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf\\'s or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nc) Gaming play + Chips\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIncludes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia\\n\\nWinner : Nvidia ( Little partial )\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nReason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren\\'t suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It\\'s kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i\\'m gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don\\'t want you to buy intel.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nd ) Payment play\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIncludes : VISA, Master card, PayPal\\n\\nWinner : Paypal\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nReason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\ne ) The others\\n\\nRest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio.  \\n\\n\\nAlso i don\\'t want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube.  \\n \\n\\nAnd then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don\\'t then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWinner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk )\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nf ) International\\n\\nSince China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIncludes : BABA, JD, Tencent  \\n\\n\\nWinner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public )\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nReason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater.  \\n\\n\\nRemember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNote : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven\\'t given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Tesla + TMF](https://preview.redd.it/c5lz9sd7h8191.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a41dbbe1fa648d893173647ef039243f0224722a)\\n\\n[The amount has not yet been credited yet.](https://preview.redd.it/bu29d5g7h8191.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3cbe69fa87a1db5598fcd2b7974c53829d542d6)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Result :** It shall be knows until 2024-2025.\\n\\n**Conclusion :** Fuck i don\\'t know if it will work.

This indicates that there are several clusters already, but they are still undetected.**\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*What is Monkeypox?\\\\*\\\\*I am not going to describe it here in detail, just google it – the pictures speak for themselves.\\n\\n* Symptoms include fever, headache, chills.\\n* **Lesions however are very ugly and developed within 1-3 days**\\n* The death rate is approximately 5-10% in Africa, however it would probably be lower in the US / Europe with better health care available.\\n\\nThere are two strains - one from DR Congo, the other one is dominant in the West African region. The Congo strain is more severe and also has a higher transmission rate from human to human.\\n\\n**Already after looking at the pictures from google I would like to get vaccinated against it. Not that the lesions would make me any uglier, but still...**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Transmission**\\n\\n* Transmission from animals (primary) occurs through bites or scratches\\n* Secondary transmission human to human through broken skin, membranes like eyes or the mouth OR respiratory droplets (which means WSB-Members are not likely to ever contract it in their basements)\\n* Secondary transmission occurs as well through contaminated clothing or linen as was found in a study\\n* [More Information (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/transmission.html)\\n* There are several studies available that have looked into the dynamics of the transmission and there is a chance for high transmission rates within households\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Why is it spreading now?**\\n\\nTo me this is the biggest mystery of the current outbreak. The disease has been endemic in the Congo for decades and there were single outbreaks e.g. in the US in 2003. [https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/monkeypox---the-united-states-of-america](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/monkeypox---the-united-states-of-america).\\n\\nAn outbreak also occurred in Nigeria from 2017 until 2019 with 122 confirmed cases with a death rate of 6%.

The fact that contacts between the individuals could not be confirmed in all cases suggests that there are more unknown clusters which in return means that there will be more and more cases.**\\n\\nWhile I was writing this DD today 2 more cases were confirmed in the UK.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Threat**Smallpox (Monkeypox is similar) were eradicated around 40 years ago and everyone born after 1980 has likely not received any vaccination which means in case the virus has found a way to spread more easily within humans we have a pretty serious disease again with no protection at the moment.\\n\\nIn a study a 5.2-fold lower risk of Monkeypox infection was seen in those who had received Smallpox vaccination than unvaccinated persons ([https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/13/6/06-1540\\\\_article](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/13/6/06-1540_article)) which leads us to the next point.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Catalysts**\\n\\n1. Scenario (COVID 2.0)The virus has mutated and has found ways to be transmitted more easily starting now with transmissions inside certain communities and groups. This would be COVID 2.0 all over again with associated effects for vaccine makers (see below).\\n2. Scenario (Slow Transmission) - More LikelyThe virus has not mutated badly however it will continue to spread slowly and now has caught the attention of governments, the WHO and the public. A potential infection can be mitigated by getting a Smallpox vaccine which all of us havent since the 1980s.

Canada reported just now [13 suspicious cases](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/monkeypox-cases-under-investigation-canada-215430663.html). The man who got infected in the US now travelled to Canada before - so there might be some kind of connection, I doubt they all touched the same dogs or squirrells. Usually the virus is also not that easy to transmit from human to human.The incubation time for this virus is quite long with more than 10 days, so what we are seeing now already happened weeks ago.\\n\\nUpdate 3:  (From BnoNews) Updated list of monkeypox cases:   \\n \\\\- Portugal: 14 confirmed, 6 suspected   \\n\\\\- UK: 9 confirmed   \\n\\\\- Spain: 7 confirmed, up to 40 suspected   \\n\\\\- Canada: 13 suspected   \\n\\\\- Sweden: 1 confirmed   \\n\\\\- USA: 1 confirmed (Massachusetts)   \\nTotal: 32 confirmed, 59 suspected   \\n\\n\\nIt is highly unlikely that all these people either had the same human contacts across continents or were in contact with animals where they could have contracted the virus - this points to the fact that the virus spreads from human to human more easily than in the past.\\n\\n**Do whatever you want with this information.

I messed up my schedule because I partied a lot this Sunday. Also, there was a light cut off in my region on Monday and my laptop is a gaming one. No backup ff\\'s. So I will make sure to add bonus content about Monday. \\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEnough of my BS lets get started…!!!\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\* Edited like 2-3 times because of spacing. I have no clue why it happened. Apologies again. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Good morning**\\n\\n**Respected Traders and Investors,**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHoly shit, you\\'re not doing well at all and are hanging by a thread at the mercy of Federal Reserve, or should i say, Joe F Biden.  XD\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI told you , I told you so. Victory day will be the end of “Buy at the sound of cannons and sell at the noise of trumpets rally” Meaning we will be making a lower low to the price which we did on Feb-march period of time. I also told you Institutions and HFs will be analyzing the CPI data and then decide if the market goes up or down. And that’s the gist of what happened this week, my friends. \\n\\nAnd you guys must be wondering, why is this guy right every single time. How does he do that. What metrics does he look at. Well, my friends let me clarify this beforehand. I am not an expert at literally anything. Every individual across this reddit group is a more intellectual person than I am and is probably making tons of money. I’m just a normal chess player who fell in love with every asset class across the world.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Others : White, Stock Market : Black](https://preview.redd.it/h4put00nztz81.jpg?width=5184&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b09d0f8fcf0cd73e7b9d80cf5a45969a8d22565)\\n\\nI look at the stock market as a player in black pieces and hedge funds, institutions, and me myself as playing with white. Sometimes the stock market plays so well that we think of it as someone using stock fish engines (hence many people simply DCA index), and sometimes he plays horribly like a 100 ELO rating player. And so we all have our own theories and different perspectives on how to beat the stock market. But there is only one game that wins quickly and precisely without a single mistake or inaccuracy, thereby giving max returns and hence beating the stock market, but that game is played by the composite man using the alpha-zero engine. So the people\\'s job in this field is to think about how the composite man might be playing with his pieces and then play their own game. They can either choose to play offensive or sometimes play defense. Hence, sometimes they beat the stock market and sometimes they don’t. The movement of pieces of stock market (in black) can be analyzed by looking at technical chart.\\n\\nSo\\n\\nA) either come up with your own ideas to beat the beat the stock market by DCA index, day/swing trading, investing money in multiple value and growth stocks (lump sum/DCA)\\n\\nor just simply B) observe the pieces and what game is being played by other players on this field. Now this player could be your favorite YouTuber, Nancy Pelosi, some reddit guy YOLOing or any other hedge fund.\\n\\nIn this subreddit group, my friends, we come up with our own theories and ideas on where the USA stock market is going. By figuring out the direction where black pieces are moving beforehand, we look at the range, where it is headed and hence invest or trade money then. We also identify the risk on/off mood of the market where it could pump or dump.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Hence FYI : This is not financial advice. It’s just my own unique style of play.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo currently my play, as you all know, is pretty simple : Build cash and DCA at key levels for the next cycle. ( when Dow Jones hits 50wMMA (min) - 200wMMA (max) or SPX hits 200wMA (min) ) But today, my friends, I\\'m gonna give you a short term idea for 2022.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSorry for the long intro guys.

Now 2019-2025. Are we in a 90yr recurring cycle? )\\n\\n\\\\-----------------------------\\n\\nSymptoms :\\n\\nDownward trend with some reaction rally to upside which ultimately gets sold off.\\n\\nWorst performance of year since 1929 great depression.\\n\\nReacting to Oil prices, high inflation, Jobs/Wages data, FED interest rate talk no jutsu.\\n\\n\\\\-----------------------------\\n\\nProcedure :\\n\\nGod knows. All we know is that we have to avoid the max spread of the disease. The FED has to keep raising rates and expect that consumers will stop spending like crazy and bring demand inflation down. If they don\\'t then expect a rug pull in September FOMC.\\n\\n\\\\-----------------------------\\n\\nMedical Cure :\\n\\n\\\\- FED put. (cannot work right now because we need inflation to come down first and not throw gasoline into the fire)\\n\\n\\\\- Peace b/w Ukraine and Russia or Putin needs to go.\\n\\n\\\\- China Economy opens (Cannot recommend this before peace talks because it will cause Oil shock)\\n\\n\\\\- Volcker Shock ( Should bring inflation down but bring Economic Depression )\\n\\n\\\\-----------------------------\\n\\nSo we diagnosed the problem and the medical report says \"We are walking b/w min-mid spread of the disease\" This doesn\\'t look good for investing purposes or HODL in 2022-2024 ( FED tightening will take 2yrs to come into effect ).\\n\\nSo we\\'ve got no choice other than to \"Swing trade\".\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Experiment : Swing trade 2022**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Hypothesis :**\\n\\n\\\\- A sea of red looming in Q4 2022. Most probably 3rd week of september (Quadruple witching of the worst month) or Oct 24-27 (History of crashes) due to recession looming somewhere in 2022-23 ( yield curve inversion and first -ve quarter of GDP)\\n\\n\\\\- Inflation comes down without Volcker shock.\\n\\n\\\\- Expect 75bps and get 50bps in June-July FED meetings.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Step 1 :** Look at the Nasdaq/QQQ  monthly chart and analyze it.\\n\\n[Chart 1 : QQQ, Indicators : Stochastic RSI, RSI, PVT \\\\(O\\\\)](https://preview.redd.it/yeuzcvz5lzz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=efbf898f03e32971022aca9b37f5915cb8ebc708)\\n\\nChart 1 :\\n\\n\\\\- Stoch RSI bottom with numbers matching left and right. Meaning no significant down move possible with room for a slight leg up in the bottom, though ( like 2008 )\\n\\n\\\\- RSI has a history of bouncing b/w 40-45.\\n\\n\\\\- PVT(O) is already in the max pain accumulation zone.

Two green strong months are coming. Est : July , August.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Step 2 :** Look at SPX/SPY monthly chart and analyze it.\\n\\n[Chart 1 : SPY, Indicators : Stochastic RSI, RSI, PVT\\\\(O\\\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7ajo8g3ymzz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c36e599daab4afe868820d875360df2776812f2)\\n\\nChart 1 :\\n\\n\\\\- Stoch RSI bottom.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\- RSI at 40-45 zone.

One green month is coming in August. Rally doesn\\'t look strong in comparison to Nasdaq.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Step 3 :** Let\\'s look at bonds\\n\\n[Chart 1 : \\\\(1950 - 2022\\\\) Blue line : Bond yields , Orange line : Dow Jones , Blue line : Inflation](https://preview.redd.it/r3qgnk4lozz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1bd1e5ac4212f5814d07e1182240acaa6502a20)\\n\\nChart 1 :\\n\\n\\\\- Bond breakout is confirmed. Target : 4.5% min. Max (as per history) : 8-10% which sounds ludicrous right now.\\n\\n\\\\- There is no reason to believe that yields go up, then stocks go down. It just means that bonds will become more lucrative to investors and stock indices could have their volatile moves up and down. (Taking into account inflation is under control)\\n\\n\\\\- If inflation is running hot over 5% then bonds and stocks get hammered together.\\n\\nAlso, rising interest rates are bad for bonds. But if they are already priced in by looking at terminal rates, then it\\'s all good. A change in terminal rates to fight hot inflation will make bonds and stocks prices fall.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Chart 2 : TLT](https://preview.redd.it/71qu7t4lozz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=972c47c0740347c4d5a09a9b7ac6d714a0811150)\\n\\nChart 2 :\\n\\n\\\\- I have explained this chart millions of times by now. It said to start buying TLT b/w 15 may - 15 june. Well, we are now past 15. But applying bar charts cannot simply predict days.\\n\\n\\\\- Let\\'s look at some more technical stuff :\\n\\na) Fib retracement from 2008 : $118 ( 61.8% ) , $101 ( 78.6% )\\n\\nb) Fib trend ext currently : $107 ( 1 fib ), $78 ( 1.618 )\\n\\n\\\\- We are currently touching 200 MMA and have a weekly death cross of 50 and 200 which seems to have already made the price go down like 2008.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nResult : Low yield bonds with AAA safety will get bought before an economic uncertainty or financial crisis. Making stocks fall more. Hence, buy bonds in q2 and sell in q4 peak fear. Provided inflation comes down by August.\\n\\nIf inflation doesn’t come down by September, expect bonds to get destroyed with equities or whatever asset in Q4. Volcker shock will screw everything up.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Step 4 :** Let\\'s look at our cash. Some might say Tesla, but I say Apple because it has proven the test of time.\\n\\n[AAPL chart : White : 50MMA , Orange : 100MMA , Red : 200MMA. Will follow DJI](https://preview.redd.it/6dzgpq7jqzz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4eed1c152cde980b4092981921ab20e86f091372)\\n\\n4 things have been concerning me here :\\n\\n\\\\- Since the financial crisis of 2008 volume has been declining, but prices of the stock have been rising.\\n\\n\\\\- Apple is in a rising wedge and has broken a trendline. Technical target is $100 or 50 MMA. i.e., $95.\\n\\n\\\\- Apple tests 50wMMA every time stochastic RSI goes in the lower deep water region.\\n\\n\\\\- Apple\\'s Q2 outlook wasn’t good. Meaning it could fall here before the crisis comes in Q4.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNote : Apple has never made it to 100w MA since the Dotcom bubble collapse, but we all know it was a joke at that time.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Step 5 :** VIX & SKEW\\n\\n[VIX](https://preview.redd.it/vbaanvthrzz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3ae0aac537bf645a358707a94a902342a9a2aa6)\\n\\nThe VIX at 50, is coming this year.\\n\\nIf the VIX remains elevated for a longer period of time, it would only mean more uncertainty in the market.\\n\\n[SKEW](https://preview.redd.it/cpref4thrzz81.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=7063bf58904aa35fe515eb9ee70101f54b62a902)\\n\\nPuts are coming off the market, but prices are at decent lows.\\n\\nMeaning first an exit liquidity rally, then if people start buying more puts, you can only imagine the carnage to come later in Q4.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Step 6 :** Housing Collapse\\n\\n[Purple line : Housing Index, Orange : 30yr bond yields, Sky blue line : Interest rates.](https://preview.redd.it/tow6oo05szz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f78228fc8fbf4a593e3caf0318df515183261b3d)\\n\\nMany people were asking why am I saying that the “Housing Market” will collapse in Q4. What I wanted to say was housing prices will start coming down in Q4 due to inventory build-up ( lumber prices are coming down ) , plus interest rates skyrocketing to 2% by the end of the year. The prices have rose enough and now the only way is down.\\n\\nThe absolute bottom of prices will be visible in 2024. But for a crash in Q4, we need a volcker shock on housing in 2022 itself. If it happens it will break the housing market. Powell promised us he wouldn\\'t do that until August-September CPI data. So watch out for that.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Step 7 :** So we talked about money and housing. Well then let\\'s talk about a sensitive topic called wheat. I’m not here to explain where wheat is used. You guys are smart and can figure it out yourself by observing day-to day life.\\n\\n[Wheat Futures \\\\/ Average US median income](https://preview.redd.it/pwsznbtpszz81.png?width=1547&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1d702dc3a8e09313f98f5f1208d925a138e6270)\\n\\nWhat I can do is plot a graph of wheat futures and divide it by our median household income. What I found was that wheat prices have been on a dramatic rise. Now what does it mean when prices go up? It means either the demand is quite high or the supply has decreased. In this case, we all know it\\'s the latter (Ukraine + India + Russia factors).\\n\\nSo what does it mean ? It means food shortages are real. If America doesn\\'t start producing enough and people keep thinking that they can flip NFTs or trade options, then we are in trouble. We cannot just assume that the other person is gonna produce things. Who knows, maybe the other person is under the same impression. This topic is subject to dispute and everyone can come up with their own case. But I thought, just let\\'s bring this up to raise awareness among people.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Conclusion :**\\n\\n1. Buying an index is a lot safer than picking stocks at the moment because you never know. (Just told you with apple stock. 50wMMA  becould come before Q4)\\n2. In Index analysis (i.e. SPY , QQQ) expect 1/2 months of green (July, August) and more profitable to buy Nasdaq because its all beaten up, bad plus historical analysis.\\n3. I do not know the exact bottom in May, June. Could be much lower from here. But what I know is a rally is about to start post-FOMC in June for NASDAQ and SPX post July FOMC. I have no idea why that is an inconsistency. I’m just telling you what my charts tell me.\\n4. FED If - else statement\\n\\nIf\\n\\nThe FED controls inflation, then bonds buy date will be May-June period and pain for equities in Q4 where the low yield bond prices will be high as investors will turn on the safety notch to gear  (Second derivative rise in the prices of bonds could crash equity)\\n\\n(Hence, Housing market collapse by 2024)\\n\\nElse\\n\\nThe FED has no control over inflation and Volcker shocks us. Then bonds and equities get hammered together with other financial assets come Q4.\\n\\n(Hence, Housing market collapse by 2022-23)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Result :** \\n\\nEither way. A crisis is looming for the equities market in September - October 2022, period.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Invalidation :**\\n\\nEvery theory and experiment has an invalidation case.\\n\\nMy theory has just 1.\\n\\nIf FED breaks something in a tightening cycle which hasn\\'t even begun yet (starts June) then we could see indices and stocks plummet more like in 2018 after FED decided to shrink its balance sheet. On average it was a 7-8% drop.\\n\\nQE : FED buys treasuries in the open market.\\n\\nQT : FED sells treasuries in the open market. (Selling is of two types. Let treasuries mature or not)\\n\\nHence, June is so important. We will see then, if these balance sheets selling by the FED are priced in or not by the bond market. If the answer is no, then no fake exit liquidity rally in July-August. Bond prices will fall with equities.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**For this week ahead.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Bloomberg Week](https://preview.redd.it/c9o3ble9yzz81.png?width=1771&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c97a919668de5a84ca0b5fa610c7566c090beb3)\\n\\nMonday (Bonus) Content :\\n\\n\\\\- We had construction worker data which is a leading indicator to recession and it has never been wrong which says recession in 2023 is 10000% guaranteed.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\- Manufacturing data from China was so bad on Monday, but don\\'t let this fool you.

Or, my attempt at what DD should be that perhaps only moderately sucks. It only mentions Chamath one other time than this if that eases your smoothed-out brains (or triggers them). Brace yourself, I get all poetic license with punctuation. Or don’t, because you won’t read...either way.\\n\\nTo be clear, I wouldn’t make a bet based on what I say, but maybe some will find it useful/supplemental. I want to do more of these, so quick plug for the Pre-Market crew to host a DD How-To as they've mentioned, I'd be all over that.\\n\\n**From:** a fellow smooth-brained operator that worked in the Managed Care space negotiating contracts as a provider, and has contracted with this company/has seen the tech.\\n\\n**Target Price** – this could be variable, but I am targeting a share price of 1 P/S for 2022 Projected Sales (I estimate over $7 based on current guidance – which is over $3 billion in revs). Mostly because I am a moron and I don’t see how 1 \\\\* Sales isn’t a good price for this level of growth and I think they will hit their sales target (which I will say like 6 times). Maybe my fellow apes can assist with valuation. Discounted cashflows were not specifically calculated, but management did signal cash flow positive by year-end on the annual call. Their major established competitors are trading at over 1.20 sales to just over 2 P/S (UNH, ANTM, CI), with an exception for CNC. The idea is that as Clover closes the gap on cash flow positive, and posts the revenues it is expected to, it would trade closer to the ratio that its counterparts trade at. The competition outside of Centene has a roughly 1% dividend, but they also don’t have the same growth trajectory (though, United does seem to impress sometimes, mostly due to Optum in my experience). Variable target because cash flow could come sooner/later, or revs could take a different trajectory.  I’d amend my target then. Next earnings 5/9/22.\\n\\nThe one other caveat to my target price is that I want to sell before the CEO dilutes with more shares. The only distribution was Q4 last year (at least, that is what I saw on SEC filings). With that said, depending on how the year goes, I will wait for Q4 this year to sell, and potentially buy on a dip/roll into January 2024 calls based on updated guidance on membership/revs throughout the year and after further dilution is absorbed after CEO/executive comp hits. According to the 10K the CEO was awarded these shares on 1/7/2021, but maybe someone can educate me here – I didn’t think I saw the dilution until Q4. Also, I am not an expert on the options side, but I don’t care, and will learn the hard way.\\n\\nClover is both a Managed Care Organization (MCO) and Direct Contracting Entity (DCE), which will come in handy later.\\n\\n**“Aand awaaaay we goo”:**\\n\\n**Why will Clover win?**\\n\\nClover is at its heart a tech company (not saying I will value it as such being it is in the Managed Care space). Their Clover Assistant is this tech and it is pushed onto providers like providers used to push drugs onto innocent people (sorry, it is true – they used to bother the fuck out of me to get this Clover Assistant deployed, and it worked). The tech does work too, though. Patients being treated by providers using Clover Assistant have a reduced Medical Cost Ratio when compared to patients treated by providers that do not leverage the tool.\\n\\n(MCR = Cost of Care/PMPM (per member per month) Revenues for the year (see 10K and supplemental data))).\\n\\nSo, even if I don’t capture all the aspects of why Clover Assistant positions Clover to profit, the numbers speak for themselves in terms of medical outcomes (and thusly, medical spend). They publish this in a few places, here is one:\\n\\n[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213)\\n\\nThere was an even better graphic that illustrated that the longer the patient was being treated by a provider using CA, the lower the MCR for that group made it for the prior year's cohorts (so, if they started FY 2018, MCR would be lower than if they started on FY 2019, etc) . I got bored of trying to find it again, I thought it was in the 10K, but my 'MCR' in the Find function didn’t actually find it for me. I saw it, if you need to, go find it.\\n\\nThis tech gives Clover a few advantages. I try to cover the main ones here, and you will have to trust the results in a lower cost of care to prove this to be true:\\n\\n1. **More accurate coding**. If they are capturing more co-occurring diagnosis codes for their members/more severe, accurate versions of those diagnoses, they can capture more revenue for themselves via an enhanced RISK Score which enhances their PMPM revenue that CMS pays (currently over 50% of their revenue, projected to be 1/3 in 2022).\\n2. **Better communication to the Primary Care Provider (PCP)** about the recent hospital visits/other types of care. Care Coordination is done by most MCOs, but direct communication back to PCPs through the software they need to log on to when the patient is facing them helps them be better informed based on the claims history that they wouldn’t traditionally have access to directly.  This allows providers to make better decisions that impact patients' long-term health trajectories.\\n3. **It even offers PCPs recommendations for other, in-network specialists so that the PCP can give recommendations based on who will treat the patient at a lower cost of care** when being referred out (being in-network means that have contracted rates rather than the provider referring to another specialist provider who will charge a metric fuckton in ‘charges’. I can attest. These charges are often what you hear about in sensationalized healthcare cost articles, that is a conversation for a different day, healthcare is still expensive). This matters to the PCP because they genuinely care about their fixed-income patients, and would want to limit their out-of-pocket exposure if the information was readily available to share.  Traditionally, they may not assist here and patients will just go to some out-of-network provider potentially.\\n\\nClover Assist is also used in provider offices for traditional Medicare patients through the Direct Contract model (where Clover isn’t the insurer, but a financial intermediary). I know less about that other than they receive the capitation payments and take on all the medical expense for the attributed membership (that is, the members of the provider partners) - they act as Medicare, essentially and to me, this is fucking semantics, but the take away is larger market size. They have proven to have the powerful tech to perform in this space being that the overall goal is to increase quality of care and reduce medical spend as a byproduct (because of the MCR thing where they do better with patients whose provider uses Clover Assistant\\\\^). This is an interesting fact because their target population isn’t only those who are comfortable enough to enroll with a Medicare Advantage product (roughly \\\\~45% of Medicare-eligible people enroll in a managed care plan), but all Medicare-eligible folks, potentially. I don’t know of another MCO doing this.\\n\\nAnecdotally, staff members at the provider sites that use Clover Assist never really complained about it and say it is easy to use. I have surveyed some of them myself back then. These are folks that want to complain about all new tech. They are inundated with new software all the time that ends up being clunky. Even if new software is better/easier to use they hate it because it is different than the ‘greenscreen’ tech they’re used to in their old providers' offices based out of their old homes. This problem is fucking chronic in its own right, but I digress.\\n\\n**Other Tailwinds/Feel Good Shit**\\n\\n* Insurance business membership is up 25% beginning January 2022.\\n   * This is at least the second year they beat the average growth rate.\\n      * I’ve seen their growth in industry reporting for my market at the time (market = state), and this growth is what ultimately caused my organization at the time to contract with them.  I always took notice and I am mediocre at best. I spent most days reading what you ‘tards were up to.\\n* This includes 101 new counties where Clover can now establish itself and its brand. This is almost double the 2021 numbers.\\n* This is better than average (\\\\~10%) membership increase, but they are still not one of the largest Medicare Advantage players in terms of total membership.\\n* STAR Rating Increase to 3.5 last year.\\n   * This is huge. STAR ratings not only affect the PMPM rates paid to the MCO (Clover insurance business), but also the automatic membership allocation (I know this happens from working at a publicly-traded MCO a few years ago, I don’t know why some members are automatically allocated, but it happens). This windfall doesn’t really impact their PMPM rates until 2023, but I believe they have the tech to climb to a 4.0 in FY 22 benefitting future cash flows in 2024 (but would still need to be priced in). Also, just general experience with CMS and the HEDIS/STARS processes, etc. will help in this effort. STAR rating matters and getting to 4 or better will put them in a much better position from a margin standpoint and a marketing standpoint. Admittedly, this is speculation, but the news should be well-received if they land it. It is for sure their goal, and they’re already growing at a high rate in terms of membership without this card in their pocket. If they increased their STAR, I would consider making this a longer play.\\n* Dilution from convertible debt should be over according to the 10K. Convertible debt is finally nil.\\n* Leadership hinting at profitable quarters by Q4 (at least on a cash basis). Revenues are easier to predict outside of some adjustment items (see next bit)…they are likely being conservative on the medical cost side due to what just happened with covid - they got hammered.\\n* Projecting to 2x revenue compared to FY21. This is somewhat easy to gauge as they know roughly their average PMPM and open enrollment is closed, so membership shouldn’t have the opportunity to really dip at all until 2023. It should only grow slowly from folks that can qualify outside of Open Enrollment countered by members who unfortunately pass on to...wherever it is they believe they go. This assumption could be confirmed by beating top-line estimates for the last 4 quarters even if they have missed EPS. The one caveat to this is retroactive adjustments based on RISK score/other potential adjustments that may escape my current capacity of understanding.\\n* Covid headwinds should really be abated at this point. They operate in some tough states for covid. NJ is their biggest market (I believe it still is, it is where they started), and NJ got clobbered by covid. Some of the other states are states where covid measures were late/ignored. This carried into 2021 because care was interrupted as well as the use of Clover Assist had diminished some with a lot of telehealth visits taking place over traditional ones (not as thorough of a visit with this population). More ‘elective’ surgeries were pushed back, which increased the severity of underlying issues in aggregate, this also these procedures carried into 2021 along with other, smaller covid surges. I believe 2022 seems to present a decreased risk of Covid-related expense/impacts so far – and relatively speaking.\\n* Insider Trades\\n   * Chamath bought $10 million in shares over $5 in November 2021.\\n   * Chelsea Clinton (on the board) recently bought $250K shares as well as at least one other insider so far in Q1 2022.\\n   * Previously issued shared in 2021 offering were at $5.75, presumably wouldn’t see much sell for less than that (okay, not really insider trade, but seems relevant).\\n   * No insider sales that I can see.\\n* **Direct Contracting (TLDR – big growth),** which again puts Clover in a financial intermediary position rather than an insurer (semantics, difference is they are technically signed up as traditional-Medicare, and Clover assists the providers), is set to explode – they will need to learn/execute in this space, though. They landed contracts with provider communities in 8 states for the 2021 FY. They have ramped up to 22 states in 2022 (to be clear CMS needs to approve, they just don’t get to enter because they have contracts, as I understand it). Their success can grow exponentially without even adding states if they execute and share savings with providers. The provider community will spread that success via word of mouth (which, medical results being compared to covid times should put them in a position to win, should). Providers are very much $ driven if they don’t harm their own patients (or sometimes it is about excluding the poor ones, I digress). So if they can pawn the labor off and still make money, they will.  While the direct contracting model did take some flak in the news from some politicians, CMS/Medicare isn’t going to get away from the value-based model any time soon in my opinion. It is known as the future. Medicare is, however, getting away from providers volunteering to participate in value-based programs, so partnering with a DCE (Clover in this example) is appealing to them because they can ‘do less’ while remaining compliant and not losing patients. I don’t know a ton about this program as I worked on the provider side, and we had our own internal team who worked with our providers for their participation in this CMS program as they largely did work similar to this already. Clover did approach us on participating, they will have more luck with the smaller groups in my opinion – or the really large provider-owned groups. Mine was hospital-owned. Clover is taking on full-risk at least most of the time in this model, which obviously is full risk in costs, full reward in savings. They’re betting big that they can do better than Medicare and their reward is that they get to keep the money that Medicare would have otherwise spent (keep in mind, they also offer ALL of the services Medicare does, they cannot destroy patients’ lives to do this, they must manage their health to do it). I don’t find a stretch that they can be more effective than the government.  Some experts may consider this an oversimplification.\\n   * As I stated earlier, this is all populations that are not selecting a Medicare Advantage plan. This opens their target market to anyone that participated with Medicare, essentially. Meanwhile, the MCO’s will fight over Medicare Advantage (which, I have heard plan presidents of major insurers call a cash-cow when done properly…multiple times).\\n* They also participate in every benefit enhancement CMS offers for MA (for higher PMPM revenue, the risk is also they offer more services than traditional) in every market they operate. Their whole schtick is ‘more for less’, but that tells me they put their money where their mouth is.\\n* Aside from claims payable, which all MCO’s carry like A/P and isn’t really debt, they are relatively low/no debt.\\n* Their main technical competition would be Optum (United), but I have not seen them on any DCE list. So, they do not participate in Direct Contracting yet. They are the major player in insurance by a large margin and that carries into Medicare Advantage too. If anything, I would see them as the buyout candidate, though, I do not believe that is the goal at all – don’t get me wrong.\\n* I consider the tech their moat if they can keep utilization/engagement up, and continue increasing the lives that are on it.\\n\\n**Other/Restated Headwinds**\\n\\nCash was $300 million at the end of 2021. They burnt that much in operations (roughly) through 2021. They recently closed a share offering after the 3rd quarter 2021 earnings. The only reason I am not nervous about cash is the fact that their revenues should grow with expenses due to membership and if they needed cash, they would have tried to make sure they had at least a year’s worth when completing the offering (and said as much in the 10K). Covid did a number on Clover, but the large bulk of that is over, I believe they have enough cash to take them to cash-flow-positive in FY22.\\n\\nTo go along with this, Management must reduce both MCR (for insurance business) and DCM (for direct contracting business). If these are not reduced to under 100% each, cash headwinds will become greater sooner and I may have to change my thesis. I believe this is the key metric to look for in the next earnings as I expect them to hit/come close to revenue and membership (since it is, again, mostly known).\\n\\nI believe there are measures on Clover Assistant that are also published, but this is likely going to increase with more membership/DCE expansion. What would be really interesting is watching the lives managed under the tool. The more of their lives as a % of the total that can be managed under the tool, the more likely they are to decrease MCR and DCM in the coming quarters/years. Providers discontinuing their utilization would be bad (but really only a risk on the insurance side, DC participants have to as part of the deal).\\n\\nAny pandemic residual impacts could creep up again. New variants, etc that could cause more butts in hospital beds. That would be bad for cash.\\n\\nAny further dilution could change my target, but I don't expect this until later in the year.\\n\\n**TL/DR –** I bought CLOV $5 calls 1/2023, considering 1/2024 after earnings. I also hold shares at an average of $3.27. Target for now roughly $7, and some combination of being in the money/ridiculous IV for the calls. Clover good – growth big – technology work – buy at own risk. What do I know? I am just a bag holder.  For what it is worth, my gains on the calls are covering my share losses so far because of timing.\"}]\n"
